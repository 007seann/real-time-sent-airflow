The ECB is expected to hold rates steady after firing off 450 points of rate hikes since July of 2022. As for the Federal Reserve, members will be in a blackout period ahead of the next FOMC meeting in November, but the \"higher for how much longer\" guessing game will go on.

Commercial cloud revenue is forecast to jump to $31B in Q3 and be a highlight of the report. The Seattle tech giant is expected to churn up adjusted operating income of $24.1B on a margin rate of 44.3%. The bull thesis on Microsoft hinges in parts on the three A's (Azure, AI, &amp; Activision), while the cautious view on the tech giant is that the macroeconomic backdrop and high level of interest rates will keep the valuation in check. The very latest read from Evercore ISI on the Microsoft print is that Azure revenue guidance may surprise to the upside. Other factors seen working in Microsoft's favor are easier Windows comparisons in 2024, O365 copilot monetization, continued growth in demand for Azure AI services, the impact of Activision on gaming estimates, further share gains in security, and a continued balance between revenue and op-ex growth. The firm's view is that at 29X CY24 EPS, Microsoft remains an attractive EPS/cash flow compounding story with a significant amount of upside optionality around AI, cloud and gaming over the next few years. Morgan Stanley said it remains firmly convinced that there is a large opportunity ahead of Microsoft within Generative AI and the company's strong positioning to execute to that opportunity, however warned investors must keep in mind the timing of enterprise adoption cycles in setting expectations for upcoming results. On Seeking Alpha, analyst JR Research is with expectations still running high for MSFT as we head into its fiscal first-quarter earnings release, a worse-than-expected report by the company could send holders running for cover. That could open up a more attractive opportunity for patient investors to capitalize. Options trading on Microsoft implies a 5.5% swing in share price after the report drops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Coca-Cola earnings preview:</strong> Organic revenue is forecast to rise 6.9% during the quarter off a 6.2% increase in pricing and 1.3% increase in unit volume, which will offset negative impacts from FX and M&amp;A. Organic revenue for the North America segment is forecast to be up 4.8%. Evercore ISI said that heading into the end of 2023, investor attention is now shifting to 2024. The firm noted that commercial momentum remains strong to support the top line, but Coca-Cola will see less pricing benefits as the company laps 2022-2023 actions and returns to a more normal 2% to 3% environment. While lower pricing is a potential headwind, input costs continue to moderate and, despite remaining inflationary, are likely much less of a headwind in 2024 than 2023. On the earnings call, Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>) executives could be asked to discuss the consumer environment, tax litigation, strategies for the Costa business, and any potential impact from GLP-1 weight loss drugs. Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>) could also delve into its plans with alcohol partnerships. The beverage giant just announced a new partnership with Pernod Ricard SA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDRDF\" title=\"Pernod Ricard SA\">OTCPK:PDRDF</a>) to debut Absolut Vodka &amp; Sprite as a ready-to-drink pre-mixed cocktail in 2024. Nielsen data over the summer indicated that prepared cocktails continued to be the fastest growing category in distilled spirits. High Noon, Anheuser-Busch's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BUD\" title=\"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV\">BUD</a>) Cutwater Spirits and Jose Cuervo products all were red-hot during the summer with consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>All things eVTOL:</strong> The eVTOL Show USA is also on the calendar in the week ahead. The event will feature participation from Eve Air Mobility, Archer Aviation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACHR\" title=\"Archer Aviation Inc.\">ACHR</a></span>), and (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMPX\" title=\"Amprius Technologies, Inc.\">AMPX</a>). The eVTOL industry has created quite a bit of buzz in the last few weeks. Archer Aviation announced an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office to make Abu Dhabi its first international launch partner, with plans to commence air taxi operations in 2026. Archer Aviation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACHR\" title=\"Archer Aviation Inc.\">ACHR</a>) also disclosed that the U.S. Air Force provided the company with its first installment of nearly $1M on their recently announced contracts valued at up to $142 million. Meanwhile, Joby Aviation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JOBY\" title=\"Joby Aviation, Inc.\">JOBY</a></span>) CEO JoeBen Bevirt set an ambitious target to launch its commercial air taxi service in 2025. Notably, Joby delivered its first eVTOL to the Air Force last month and expanded its flight test program to include flying with a pilot on board the aircraft. Archer Aviation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACHR\" title=\"Archer Aviation Inc.\">ACHR</a>), Volocopter, and Vertical Aerospace (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVTL\" title=\"Vertical Aerospace Ltd.\">EVTL</a>) also have plans for commercial eVTOL use in the 2025-2026 timeframe. Japan's Nidec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NJDCY\" title=\"Nidec Corporation\">OTCPK:NJDCY</a>) and Brazil's Embraer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ERJ\" title=\"Embraer S.A.\">ERJ</a>) also turned some heads after receiving approval from all necessary regulatory authorities for the establishment of their joint venture, Nidec Aerospace LLC. EHang Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EH\" title=\"EHang Holdings Limited\">EH</a>) also posted its highest close in nearly two years Friday last week after the Civil Aviation Administration of China approved the start of trial air taxi operations this year, a step toward its goal of launching the world's first commercial service using passenger-carrying unmanned aerial vehicles. Lilium (LILM) is also attracting attention after it struck a partnership with a full-service air brokerage and management company to connect the company to the private jet market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Key events:</strong> Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) will update on its innovation plans as part of the company's Snapdragon Summit on October 24.

Anthropic Co-founder and Chief Scientist Jared Kaplan will be one of the speakers at the Bloomberg Technology Summit. Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) recently disclosed that it will invest up to $4B in the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup. On October 25, shareholders with Capri Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPRI\" title=\"Capri Holdings Limited\">CPRI</a>) will vote on the takeover offer from Tapestry (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPR\" title=\"Tapestry, Inc.\">TPR</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conference schedule:</strong> The conference schedule is light next week, but NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals (NRBO), Akero Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AKRO\" title=\"Akero Therapeutics, Inc.\">AKRO</a>), Sagimet Biosciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGMT\" title=\"Sagimet Biosciences Inc.\">SGMT</a>), and other healthcare firms will present at the H.C.
