In reality, however, with a total revenue of $43bn Qualcomm is one of the largest publicly traded semiconductors companies - following TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) and Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thus QCOM is now much closer to being considered a mature company as opposed to a high-growth tech name.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/13396702-16795656923465958.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Indeed, a 9.2% forward revenue growth rate is far from being considered low, but given the rapid push towards digitalization in recent years, QCOM's organic revenue growth is far more likely to be below this number in the following years than to be above it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At the same time, QCOM as a stock has not offered an attractive capital appreciation over time. For the past 10-year period, QCOM has lagged the S&amp;P 500 by a very wide margin. Only when the pandemic hit, the company was able to temporarily ride on the wave of a rapid digitalization push, but that didn't last for long.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/saupload_cc59412361c8a271ce9837b75aa038ea.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That is why, the management is now focused on growing the dividend in order to attract investors.

raise is regarding Qualcomm's capital allocation, which in my view is the most immediate impediment in front of Qualcomm's sustained dividend growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, in fiscal 2022 the company spent roughly half of its free cash flow on dividend payments and another other half on share buybacks.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p><em>We executed on our capital return commitments, returning 93% of our free cash flow, including <strong>$3.2 billion in dividends</strong> and <strong>$3.1 billion in stock repurchases</strong>.</em></p> <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552281-qualcomm-inc-qcom-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript\">Qualcomm Q4 2022 Earnings Transcript</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A major problem here stems from the fact that Qualcomm's stock-based compensation of $2.2bn represents more than a fifth of the company's cash flow from operations. At 21% it is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1416-the-roundabout-investor/articles/5841137-market-overview-preparing-to-take-advantage-of-semiconductor-stocks-at-a-discount-part-2\">one of the highest ratios within the industry.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/13396702-1679568661512905_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"696\" data-height=\"318\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/13396702-1679568661512905.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm Stock-Based Compensation to Cash Flow\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">prepared by the author, using data from Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the stock-based compensation skyrocketed in recent years, Qualcomm's annual share buybacks were increasingly used to offset shareholder dilution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/13396702-16795724269914892_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"692\" data-height=\"316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/23/13396702-16795724269914892.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm Stock Based Compensation versus Share Repurchases\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">prepared by the author, using data from Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All else being equal, this might not be such a pressing issue for the dividend, however, as we saw in the first section of this article - Qualcomm relied heavily on its high share repurchase program to increase its dividend per share. Therefore, should the amount of stock-based compensation remain elevated, QCOM's ability to sustainably increase its dividend is likely to be limited.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Following the recent dividend increase, it appears that Qualcomm's stock could be an attractive dividend growth opportunity. Although the current yield is one of the higher within the industry and dividend payments appear safe, I still have a hard time considering QCOM as an attractive dividend stock. From the Even if the risk of a recession does not materialize and the company does not experience any other difficulties related to its customer base, the high amount of stock-based compensation overshadows QCOM's ability consistently increase its dividend payments over the medium term.</p>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm's Dividend Increase: A Positive Sign But Not A Silver Bullet. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589785-qualcomm-dividend-increase-positive-sign-but-not-silver-bullet?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>Looking for better positioned high quality businesses in the semiconductors space?</p><p>You can now gain <strong>access to my highest conviction ideas in the sector</strong> by subscribing to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1416\">The Roundabout Investor</a>, where I uncover conservatively priced businesses with superior competitive positioning and high dividend yields.</p><p>Performance of all high conviction ideas is measured by <strong>The Roundabout Portfolio</strong>, which has consistently outperformed the market since its initiation.</p><p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/3/13396702-16778513709694865.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>As part of the service I also offer <strong>in-depth market analysis</strong>, through the lens of factor investing and a <strong>watchlist of higher risk-reward investment opportunities</strong>.
