In addition, Qualcomm provides systems software and components to wireless handset vendors and promotes applications and services that run on high-speed wireless networks. The company operates primarily through two segments: CDMA Technologies and Technology Licensing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>The San Diego-based $129 billion market cap Semiconductors industry company within the Information Technology sector trades at a low 15.1 trailing 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio and pays an above-market 2.8% dividend yield. Following its August 2nd Q3 2023 earnings report, the stock features a modest 24% implied volatility percentage and has a low 1% short interest.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Back in early August, QCOM reported disappointing Q3 numbers. While </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3995747-qualcomm-non-gaap-eps-of-1_87-beats-0_06-revenue-of-8_44b-misses-70m\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>earnings results</span></a><span> were slightly better than expected, a 23% YoY sales drop was driven by difficulties in China\u2019s handset market while still-high channel inventory levels were a drag on the quarter. Moreover, its IoT and Automotives segments experienced a slowdown amid international sluggishness. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Particularly problematic was the management team\u2019s cautious guidance for Q4, predicting a 25.4% revenue drop, which was below street expectations. Growth prospects may improve into 2024 amid better seasonal conditions and if China demand finally turns it around, and be on the lookout for new developments like the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 platform and improvement in Automotives (which was actually a standout area in the last quarter), Consumer IoT, and Wi-Fi 7 solutions for potential upside catalysts. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Key risks from the long side include unfavorable resolution terms with Huawei, a major player in the tech industry, and a broader global economic downturn which could lead to a lower adoption rate of smartphones worldwide. Geographically, as the company expands its presence in emerging markets, it may face challenges such as pressure on pricing or market share along with heightened competition. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Of course, further tensions and growth risks in China specifically could have adverse effects on the company's operations and profitability.

The Bloomberg consensus forecast is about on par with what BofA projects. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to rise next year before settling out above $3 per share. With low to mid-teens earnings multiples looking ahead, the stock is not all that expensive considering the growth rate, and free cash flow is steady.

Notice in the chart below that shares have repeatedly tested a key support area in the $93 to $101 area \u2013 so long as the stock is above that, then a long position can make sense technically. I see resistance at $133 \u2013 the early August (pre-earnings) peak. More important potential resistance comes into play closer to $160. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Unfortunately for the bulls, QCOM has a flat 200-day moving average, indicating no apparent uptrend. The good news is that a downtrend in the stock price that took shares from $193 to $101 has abated, and a bearish to bullish reversal is trying to take shape. A breakdown below $90 or so would be dangerous from a long point of view, though. It could be a tough slog for the bulls on any up moves due to significant volume by price up to that noted $160 point. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>While I would like to a breakout above $133, long here with a stop under $93 is a favorable risk/reward setup even with the lackluster momentum.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM: Shares Holding Key Support</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/4/36131525-16938496506140306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"737\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/4/36131525-16938496506140306.png\" alt=\"QCOM: Shares Holding Key Support\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Stockcharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>I have a buy rating on QCOM stock.
