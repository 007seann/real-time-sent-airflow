class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The first component of ROE is the profitability of the company as measured by its profit per dollar sales or its net income margin. As seen in the table, the company's net income margins in TTM are higher than its 5-year average. However, in comparison with other companies, its net income margins are not the highest. Instead, Texas Instruments has the highest net margins TTM at 44% and Broadcom at 37%. On a 5-year basis, the company with the highest net margins is Texas Instruments followed by Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The average margin for fabless and IDMs are fairly similar at 22% and 21% for TTM respectively and 22.2% and 20% for the 5-year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In terms of the top 10 chipmakers by markets, the average margin for the DAO companies (TI, STMicro and Broadcom) is the highest in both TTM and the 5-year average (35% and 25% respectively) followed by Logic chipmakers (Intel, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm) with an average of 15.5% and 20.6% on TTM and 5-year respectively. Memory chipmakers have the lowest average at 11.4% and 20.4% on TTM and 5-year respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thus, this highlights the market and type of chipmaker as not the potential main factors for its high net margins. Instead, we believe the high margins for Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Broadcom are due to company-specific factors. For example, as we previously determined, Texas Instrument's focus is on 300mm wafers which it claims are more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4420228-texas-instruments-txn-stock-limited-upside-despite-robust-analog-market\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4420228-texas-instruments-txn-stock-limited-upside-despite-robust-analog-market\" target=\"_blank\">cost-effective</a> by 40% compared to 200mm wafers which are used for <a href=\"https://semiengineering.com/demand-picks-up-for-200mm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://semiengineering.com/demand-picks-up-for-200mm/\" target=\"_blank\">analog</a> chips based on SemiEngineering. For Broadcom, the company's margins are <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/d2030782-0993-4f3a-89e8-0a6efd58c552\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/d2030782-0993-4f3a-89e8-0a6efd58c552\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> by its software margins as its Infrastructure Software segment (22% of revenue) had operating margins of 71% in FY2022 compared to 58% for its Semiconductor Solutions segment. For Qualcomm, we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435058-qualcomm-vs-mediatek-battle-of-smartphone-chipmakers\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435058-qualcomm-vs-mediatek-battle-of-smartphone-chipmakers\" target=\"_blank\">previously</a> highlighted that we believe the company's performance advantage over MediaTek provides it with pricing power as reflected by its superior margins to MediaTek in the premium smartphone AP market as discussed in our previous analysis and the company had a solid <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/premium-android-smartphone-chip-market-q1-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/premium-android-smartphone-chip-market-q1-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">share</a> of 68% of the premium market according to Counterpoint Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853098909373612_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853098909373612.jpg\" alt=\"qualcomm margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Company Data, Khaveen Investments</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We examined Qualcomm's earnings and margins in the chart above.

Its SG&amp;A as a % of revenue declined from 22% to 18.5% in FY2022 while its SG&amp;A as a % of revenue declined from 9% to 5.8%, indicating its improving scale over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, we expect the company's net margins to improve slightly going forward to 30.3% in FY2023 and reach 31.3% by 2027 as we previously determined its performance advantage and leadership in the high-end smartphone AP market, and we forecasted the company's scale to keep growing larger with our 5-year forward average of 11.7%.

Qualcomm's asset turnover is higher compared to its 5-year average, indicating improved efficiency in generating sales. On a 5-year average, the company with the highest asset turnover is AMD at 1.28x. We believe examining the TTM ratio is more appropriate to reflect the company's efficiency trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In terms of chipmaker type by IDM and fabless, the average asset turnover ratio for fabless companies is higher on a 5-year average at 0.78x compared to 0.67x for IDMs indicating that fabless companies have higher efficiency compared to IDMs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">By markets, Logic companies have the highest average asset turnover ratio based on a 5-year average at 0.82x followed by DAO and Memory (0.69x and 0.56x respectively).

However, the average asset turnover had declined in TTM for Logic companies to 0.63x as all logic companies had lower ratios.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm Profitability Analysis (FY)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2018</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2019</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2020</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2021</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Asset Turnover</p></td> <td><p>0.35x</p></td> <td><p>0.74x</p></td> <td><p>0.71x</p></td> <td><p>0.94x</p></td> <td><p>1.07x</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on the table, the company's asset turnover has improved to 1.07x in FY2022 from 0.35x in FY2018. This is because its asset growth was less than its revenue growth during the period with average revenue growth of 19.6% compared to an average asset growth rate of -0.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, we expect its asset turnover ratio to continue to improve as Qualcomm is a fabless company that has superior asset turnover compared to IDMs. This is because fabless chipmakers and IDMs have different business models. Unlike fabless companies which outsource the production of chips to dedicated foundries, IDMs incur capex to produce their chips in their own facilities. Thus, fabless companies do not need to increase their asset bases significantly to increase supply and generate sales due to their dependence on foundries. As such, we expect Qualcomm as a fabless company to continue to improve its efficiency going forward with relatively faster revenue growth than asset growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>High Financial Leverage Support ROE</strong></h2> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>TTM (Financial Leverage) (TTM)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>5-year (Financial Leverage)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Samsung</p></td> <td><p>1.37</p></td> <td><p>1.44</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>SK Hynix</p></td> <td><p>0.88</p></td> <td><p>1.89</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Intel</p></td> <td><p>1.76</p></td> <td><p>1.84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>3.09</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>6.99</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Broadcom</p></td> <td><p>3.16</p></td> <td><p>2.81</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nvidia</p></td> <td><p>1.76</p></td> <td><p>1.62</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Advanced Micro Devices</p></td> <td><p>1.29</p></td> <td><p>2.05</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Micron</p></td> <td><p>1.39</p></td> <td><p>1.60</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Texas Instruments</p></td> <td><p>1.86</p></td> <td><p>1.90</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>ST Microelectronics</p></td> <td><p>1.63</p></td> <td><p>1.76</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>1.82</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2.39</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, the last component of ROE in Dupont Analysis is the financial leverage ratio which is a measure of the solvency of a company based on its assets relative to its equity. Higher financial leverage contributes to higher ROE because it acts as a multiplier to a company's ROA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As seen in the table, Qualcomm has the second-highest financial leverage at 3.09x TTM behind Broadcom which has the highest at 3.16x which we believe is due to its M&amp;A strategy as discussed in our analysis of Broadcom previously. However, compared to the 5-year average Qualcomm's financial leverage is higher at 6.99x, ahead of the other companies. Though Qualcomm's financial leverage ratio had decreased, indicating lower leverage by the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In terms of chipmaker type, fabless companies have a higher 5-year average financial leverage compared to IDMs at 3.37x compared to 1.77x. However, this is mainly due to Qualcomm for the 5-year average. Excluding Qualcomm, the average financial leverage would be 2.16x, which is still higher than IDMs but a lower average without Qualcomm. Based on TTM, fabless companies' average financial leverage ratio is also higher than IDMs (2.3x vs 1.5x). Both Qualcomm and Broadcom's high ratios above 3x contributed to a higher average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thus, this indicates chipmaker type by IDM or fabless is not a potential factor for its high financial leverage ratio and instead could be more company specific. We then examine its financial position below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853100496135745_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853100496135745.jpg\" alt=\"qualcomm financial position\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Company Data, Khaveen Investments</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on the company's financial position chart above, the company's total assets and equity had a significant decline in FY2018. The company's equity declined as a result in FY2018 as well as its cash used for the share repurchase. The company conducted share repurchase agreements following its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/13/qualcomm-targets-16-billion-in-first-phase-of-share-buyback.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/13/qualcomm-targets-16-billion-in-first-phase-of-share-buyback.html\" target=\"_blank\">failed takeover</a> of NXP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXPI\" title=\"NXP Semiconductors N.V.\">NXPI</a>). In total, the company spent $22.8 bln on share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the other hand, the company repaid its debt a net of $5.5 bln in 2018 along with its share repurchase program. This is larger compared to subsequent years when the company had an average total net debt repayment of $1.1 bln per year. The company repaid debt every year. Its liabilities growth in the past 4 years since 2019 had average liabilities growth of -0.4% and total assets growth of 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All in all, we believe despite the company's failed takeover of the NXP, the company still benefitted shareholders by substantially repurchasing its shares ($22.8 bln) instead of repaying its debt ($5.5 bln) boosted its financial leverage ratio which resulted in a boost to its ROE with a higher multiplier of its ROA. This is better for shareholders as the company returns cash to shareholders rather than repaying debtors for its debt. Moreover, the company's cost of debt is lower than its cost of equity, thus resulting in a lower cost of capital (WACC) and is better from an investor perspective as it does not increase the equity base and dilute earnings but instead depends on loans for its business expansion. We believe this further incentivized management to manage its financial leverage. Even before 2018, the company's financial leverage had increased from 1.3x in 2013 to 2.13x in 2017. Thus, we expect the company to continue managing its financial leverage to at least maintain or increase its ratio to benefit its ROE.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Risk: Sacrifice Share and Growth for High Margins</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In our first point, we identified Qualcomm's strong net margins. Compared to MediaTek, Qualcomm's net margin of 27.4% is higher than MediaTek's at 21.53%. However, Qualcomm's <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226674/smartphone-application-processor-vendor-shipment-share-worldwide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226674/smartphone-application-processor-vendor-shipment-share-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\">market share</a> in the smartphone AP segment has been relatively flat over the past 2 and a half years. Whereas MediaTek has seen a surge in its market share going from 24% in Q1 2020 to 39% in Q2 2022. This is mainly due to MediaTek having a larger share in <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/android-smartphone-soc-market-2021/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/android-smartphone-soc-market-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper</a> phones such as Realme, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo. Previously, we analyzed MediaTek's lower pricing advantage for the lower-end AP market. <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/equities/mediatek-ratios\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.investing.com/equities/mediatek-ratios\" target=\"_blank\">MediaTek</a> had taken market share in the lower-end market and had better revenue growth of 18.2%, higher than 14% for Qualcomm. Thus, we believe Qualcomm's focus on catering to the high-end market and higher margins came at a cost of lower growth compared to MediaTek.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Verdict</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853100839869914_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/28/49636850-16853100839869914.jpg\" alt=\"qualcomm valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Khaveen Investments</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our analysis reveals that Qualcomm's superior ROE is underpinned by several key factors, namely its effective utilization of financial leverage, favorable net margins, and enhanced operational efficiency. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest improvement in the company's net margins, projecting it to rise to 31.3% by 2027. As Qualcomm operates as a fabless entity, we expect its asset turnover ratio to continue progressing, benefiting from the ability to drive sales without substantial increases in asset investments. Despite the unsuccessful NXP takeover attempt, the company has prioritized repurchasing shares over debt repayment, bolstering its financial leverage ratio and consequently magnifying its return on assets ('ROA'). Going forward, we anticipate that Qualcomm will sustain or augment its financial leverage management strategies to preserve or increase its ratio, thereby enhancing its ROE for the benefit of its shareholders. Based on our updated valuation with a revised revenue forecast for FY2023 at -14% based on prorated Q1 and Q2 revenues as the company continues to face headwinds this year, we obtained a slightly lower price target of <em>$231.24</em> (compared to $244.23 previously). This still leads to a <em>Strong Buy</em> rating with a 109.6% upside with higher projected margins as we see the company being able to keep margins stable but lower 5-year forward growth of 7% compared to 11.2% previously.</p>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm: Highest ROE Chipmaker Stock To Buy. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608072-qualcomm-highest-roe-chipmaker-stock-to-buy?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "104695", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "459509", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1168", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "584582", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115472", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "548906", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4608072-qualcomm-highest-roe-chipmaker-stock-to-buy", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608072-qualcomm-highest-roe-chipmaker-stock-to-buy", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "104695", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "khaveen-investments", "userId": 49636850, "tagId": 584582, "bio": "<p>Khaveen Investments is a Macroquantamental Hedge Fund managing a portfolio of globally diversified investments.
