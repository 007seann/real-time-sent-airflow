Credit rating of A- and above (to find companies with strong balance sheets)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">2. Dividend yield above 2% and under 5% (to find companies that pay dividends at a yield that is at an above-average rate, yet low enough to be sustainable long term)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">3. These stocks have to trade on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With the above criteria, I surfaced these six companies.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811244079743333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1541\" data-height=\"341\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811244079743333.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph Screening\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph Screening</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I excluded Honeywell (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>) from the above list for the purpose of this article because their earnings yields are below my minimum threshold of 6.5%. In addition, their current blended P/E of 21.55 and 26.72 are above their 10-year normal blended P/E of 20.19 and 22.61 respectively. My opinion is these are wonderful businesses but they are not selling at wonderful prices at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Next, I examined the total returns of each of these remaining four companies to narrow the list down further. Based on capital appreciation on an initial $10,000 investment, QUALCOMM (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a></span>) has been the best performer among these four over a 20-year period.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/12/50001627-1681310168959832_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"650\" data-height=\"134\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/12/50001627-1681310168959832.png\" alt=\"Author's compilation of data from Fast Graph\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's compilation of data from Fast Graph</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Plus, since QCOM's shares are trading 37% lower than its 52-week high, the lower stock price in itself offers a wider margin of safety for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Does this mean that QCOM is an automatic buy for the conservative investor seeking safety and total return in a recessionary environment? While everyone can applaud QCOM's past successes, we also know that a company's past performance does not predict its future performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The rest of this article will focus on whether QCOM is still a good investment moving forward. To cut to the chase, I do believe that QCOM is a buy now but not for the obvious reasons mentioned above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let me begin with a quick summary of the <strong>buy</strong> and <strong>do-not-buy</strong> thesis for QCOM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Buy Thesis: Why QCOM?</strong></h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM Has A Strong Balance Sheet That Can Handle Dividend Payments and Debt Repayment</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As mentioned in the previous segment, QCOM has a solid credit rating of A from S&amp;P Credit Global Rating. An \"A\" grade is <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/190705-s-p-global-ratings-definitions-504352\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/190705-s-p-global-ratings-definitions-504352\" target=\"_blank\">defined by S&amp;P Global Rating</a> as having a \"<em>strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligors in higher-rated categories</em>\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM currently has $8.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and an operating cash flow of $10.1 billion. All these mean QCOM is more than capable of paying the $3.2 billion in dividends that were paid out in 2022, and with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/dividend-safety\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/dividend-safety\" target=\"_blank\">dividend payout ratio</a> at just 28.0%, QCOM is definitely capable of paying an increasing dividend in the near future.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811387710621655_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1408\" data-height=\"784\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811387710621655.png\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha Financials Pages\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Financials Pages</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM does have some outstanding long-term debt due in the next few years. Based on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/16170837\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/16170837\" target=\"_blank\">2022 10K (page F23)</a>,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>At September 25, 2022, future principal payments were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023, $914 million in fiscal 2024, $1.4 billion in fiscal 2025, $2.0 billion in fiscal 2027 and $9.7 billion after fiscal 2027; no principal payments are due in fiscal 2026. At September 25, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was approximately $14.0 billion.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As noted earlier, with an operating cash flow of around $10 billion, QCOM should not have any problem repaying these.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM Is A Total Return Candidate</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM fits the bill for a total-return candidate. It is capable of providing returns in three ways. <strong>Firstly</strong>, business fundamentals have been improving from a margin perspective.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/21/50001627-16820765044024303_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1289\" data-height=\"369\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/21/50001627-16820765044024303.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph QCOM Net Margin\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph QCOM Net Margin</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Net margin improved dramatically, from 11.06% in 2017 to 29.38% in 2022, a 165% improvement in just five years - with three of those five years happening during the pandemic. With net margin expansion, what usually follows is earnings growth. QCOM has been generating increasingly higher earnings per share since 2019 at a 4-year CAGR of 46.8%. Current assets have also increased nicely at a CAGR of 9.87%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-1681995478240808_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1108\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-1681995478240808.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph EPS and Current Asset 2018 to 2022\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph EPS and Current Asset 2018 to 2022</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since share price movement is highly correlated to earnings growth, a growing EPS sets the stage for capital appreciation, rewarding patient shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Secondly</strong>, strong earnings support the company's commitment to increasing dividends. QCOM has been paying a growing dividend for <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/history\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/history\" target=\"_blank\">19 consecutive years</a>, just 6 more years to becoming a dividend aristocrat. The significance of this 19-year streak cannot be understated. QCOM operates in a cyclical industry. There had been times when its earnings fell. For instance, QCOM's adjusted operating earnings fell 13% during the Great Financial Crisis. It was worse from FY 2015 to FY 2018 when its adjusted operating earnings collapsed 41% from $5.27 to $3.10. <strong>And yet through all the ups and downs, QCOM manages to keep paying a growing dividend</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend growth investors, and especially income investors who seek dividend safety above all, will welcome such an addition to their portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, QCOM has been rewarding shareholders by repurchasing shares. Since 2014, it has reduced the basic shares outstanding from 1.7 billion shares to 1.1 billion. That commitment was reiterated when it authorized a <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/10/qualcomm-announces-new-100-billion-stock-repurchase-authorization\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/10/qualcomm-announces-new-100-billion-stock-repurchase-authorization\" target=\"_blank\">$10 billion share repurchase program</a> in 2021, of which $8.1 billion of repurchase authority is still remaining.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-16819967142478378_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1371\" data-height=\"648\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-16819967142478378.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph Share Count\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph Share Count</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past 20 years, this company has demonstrated that it is a total return holding, rewarding its long-term shareholders with a 10x return (including dividends), turning a $10,000 investment into $100,461, handily beating a similar size investment in the S&amp;P 500.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-16819956141868684_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"264\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/20/50001627-16819956141868684.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph QCOM Performance from 2002 to 2023\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph QCOM Performance from 2002 to 2023</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In fact, if the dividends have been reinvested this entire time, the compounding effect on the total returns would have been even more remarkable.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/21/50001627-16820756870376792_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"787\" data-height=\"208\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/21/50001627-16820756870376792.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph QCOM Performance with Dividends Reinvested\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph QCOM Performance with Dividends Reinvested</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividends matter to income and dividend growth investors, and to have the assurance that the growing dividends will keep coming, investors need to see that the business can still grow and there is still market share to capture.

And recent market developments position us as one of the key enablers of the Metaverse opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The $1.892 billion growth in IoT revenue from 2021 to 2022 was due to a $951 million increase in demand, and the remaining $941 million gain came from a favorable product mix and higher selling prices, all indicating pricing power and growing demand for QCOM's \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6998016\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6998016\" target=\"_blank\">Snapdragon platforms, stand-alone Mobile Data Modems, RF transceiver, power management and integrated chipsets</a>\".</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/12/50001627-1681312973073554_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"752\" data-height=\"626\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/12/50001627-1681312973073554.png\" alt=\"Statista\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Statista</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Improvement in the Snapdragon\u2019s AI capabilities and battery life has and will open up numerous possible applications for enhanced user experiences that were previously impossible. </strong>And these improvements come at a perfect time when worldwide spending on the Internet of Things is expected to exceed <strong>$1.1 trillion in 2023</strong>. And at just $6.9 billion in 2022, QCOM's share of this <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-the-internet-of-things/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-the-internet-of-things/\" target=\"_blank\">$1.1 trillion</a> market is just the beginning and there is plenty of opportunities for future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, IoT is another huge area of growth for QCOM. In fact, if the CEO had sounded bullish on the automotive segment, he was even more bullish about the potential of the IoT segment. During Q1 2023 earnings call, he said,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>In <strong>IoT</strong>, which is poised to become our <strong>largest addressable market</strong>, our revenue stream spans across three categories: <strong>consumer</strong>, <strong>edge networking</strong> and <strong>industrial</strong>. In consumer IoT, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Oryon CPUs and upgraded AI engine has sampled on time and is exceeding our internal KPIs, delivering disruptive CPU performance per watt across tiers.</p></blockquote> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Computing</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And with Qualcomm's Oryon CPUs, QCOM is making moves into <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/11/qualcomm-oryon-custom-cpu-at-center-of-next-gen-premium-experiences-on-snapdragon-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/11/qualcomm-oryon-custom-cpu-at-center-of-next-gen-premium-experiences-on-snapdragon-platforms\" target=\"_blank\">computing</a>. In the November 2022 press release, QCOM declared its market-share-grabbing intentions loud and clear, saying that it will integrate Qualcomm Oryon into a diverse range of Snapdragon-powered products <strong>including personal computers and smartphones</strong>, as well as in \"<em>digital cockpits, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), extended reality, and infrastructure networking solutions</em>\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To summarize, there are plenty of bullish aspects when it comes to the QCOM growth story. This A-credit-rated company boasts of a strong balance sheet and an improving net income margin from 11.06% to 29.38% in just 5 years. The total return candidate has outperformed the S&amp;P over a 20-year period, rewarding patient shareholders with an 1126% gain with dividends reinvested. This dividend compounder has paid a growing dividend for 19 years, increasing the dividends at an average rate of 22.7%, and with its commitment to continue to repurchase shares and its continual efforts to diversify its revenue streams into multiple growth areas like automotive, IoT, cloud infrastructure, edge computing, data center, and computing, the company is poised to keep growing its earnings and revenue.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Not-To-Buy Thesis: Why Not QCOM?</strong></h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Safe Does Not Mean No Volatility</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM is in the semiconductor industry, an extremely cyclical one with up and down cycles. Down cycles can last for years. It is possible to buy and hold QCOM for <em>decades </em>and still underperform the market (dividends included). Yes, QCOM is an A-credit-rated company but based on historical returns it is not a \"safe place\" to hold my assets for the long term.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/saupload_cb2fa676c78f905a82df63cbdb99caf4.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This does not mean that QCOM is uninvestable. On the other hand, such down cycles in a cyclical industry are what <strong>value investors</strong> should be looking eagerly for, because an investment in QCOM at the right price and multiple to provide a large margin of safety, coupled with the patience to wait for a couple of years, is the way to think about an investment in QCOM. Industry leaders like QCOM with strong balance sheets will survive the down cycle, the recession that everyone says is coming in the next 6 to 12 months, the inflationary environment, and (almost) anything that can be thrown at them, and they will come back strong when the down cycle eventually reverts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For instance, purchasing shares of QCOM in September 2017 <strong>after</strong> <strong>it had declined 34%</strong> from April 2014 due to a drop in adjusted operating earnings and holding them for two years would have provided a handsome 25.3% total annualized rate of return by September 2019.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-1682148493876401_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1326\" data-height=\"739\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-1682148493876401.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph of QCOM\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph of QCOM</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Well, QCOM's stock has certainly taken another beating recently, giving value investors another chance. In the past 16 months, QCOM's share price fell a humbling <strong>37.6%</strong> from $188.69 on 4 January 2022 to $117.76 as of close on 21 April 2023. The blended P/E multiple that QCOM was trading at corrected from 19.46 to just 10.91. Putting that in context, the last time QCOM traded at a blended P/E of under 10 was in 2016, during the previous down cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Not everyone has the stomach to invest in cyclical industries. <strong>Do not buy QCOM</strong> if you are an income investor looking for higher-yielding stocks in the technology-and-semiconductor sector but if you are prepared for volatility, QCOM can be a good investment provided you can hold it for at least a couple of years.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Short-term Headwinds From Declining Handset Segment</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite the many exciting growth opportunities in automotive, IoT, AI processing, and data centers, all the attention is focused on handset sales because that is the largest revenue contributor. The share price decline QCOM has been experiencing is in part due to the declining handset sales.

And when handset sales across the board are <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share\" target=\"_blank\">declining</a>, investors will worry about the inevitable declining earnings that come with that.

That applies to QCOM's handset segment. When QCOM's handset segment brought in 66% of 2022's total revenue, representing a 48.7% increase in sales from 2021, it boosted QCOM's stock price to an all-time high of $188.69 in January 2022. Ironically, it is also this same largest segment that has been dragging QCOM's share price down since then. Therefore, it is fitting that <strong>when handset sales start growing again, it will be the performance of this same segment that will pull QCOM out of the hole.</strong></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">China Risk Is Not Hypothetical</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Relations between the US and China have been on edge for a few years now. The US has enacted several rounds of restrictions against China. From the export restrictions to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China\u2019s most advanced maker of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/china-microchips-tsinghua-unigroup.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/china-microchips-tsinghua-unigroup.html\" target=\"_blank\">computer chips</a> under the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/technology/trump-china-smic-blacklist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/technology/trump-china-smic-blacklist.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> administration, to the tougher policies from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/biden-chip-technology.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/biden-chip-technology.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap\" target=\"_blank\">Biden</a> administration to choke off China\u2019s ability to produce advanced chips by stopping high-tech exports to Chinese technology companies. All these actions went a long way to shape the Chinese's \"<em>Made in China 2025 campaign</em>\" roadmap to have 70% of the country's semiconductor needs to be \"<em>made in China</em>\". And because of this 2025 self-sufficiency target, more Chinese companies are developing and manufacturing their own integrated circuit products in their devices, with the end goal of replacing foreign-made products with Chinese ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And all these talks about self-sufficiency is not just sable rattling or posturing from one of the largest economies in the world. The tension upped another notch just a few weeks ago with news that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-conduct-cybersecurity-review-chipmaker-microns-products-2023-03-31/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-conduct-cybersecurity-review-chipmaker-microns-products-2023-03-31/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyberspace Administration of China</a> was conducting a review of the products sold by Micron (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Why Micron important for our discussion?</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/13/50001627-16814002716992042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"684\" data-height=\"365\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/13/50001627-16814002716992042.png\" alt=\"MU 2022 10K pg 87\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MU 2022 10K pg 87</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on MU's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6812684\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6812684\" target=\"_blank\">2022 10K</a>, the revenue from Micron's customers in China made up <strong>10.7%</strong> of the company's total revenue in 2022. That is certainly a big proportion and if MU were to lose this business or even a part of it, it will hurt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And if that 10.7% of Chinese business from Micron is a huge number, compare that with QCOM: <strong>63.6% of QCOM's 2022 revenue originates from China</strong>.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/11/50001627-16812130812342572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1275\" data-height=\"190\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/11/50001627-16812130812342572.png\" alt=\"QCOM 2022 10K page F-28\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>QCOM 2022 10K page F-28</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On top of that, the Chinese market also saw the second-greatest revenue growth almost doubling from 2020 to 2022; only the Vietnamese market grew faster but that is a much smaller revenue contributor. By comparison, the revenue from the South Korean market only grew by 6.7% while the US market grew revenue by 31.2% in the same time period. The Chinese market is certainly very important to QCOM's growth prospects. Yet, the heavy concentration of revenue originating from China is a potential problem that investors have to take into their risk assessment considerations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Competitors are Everywhere...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM has competitors in many of the same industries it sells to, and some of these competitors are among QCOM's customers. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/16170837\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/16170837\" target=\"_blank\">2022 10K</a> states,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>QCT\u2019s current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Apple, Broadcom, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Samsung is one of QCOM's largest integrated circuit customers. QCOM also sells integrated circuits to many OEMs in China, and these companies, in alignment with the \"<em>Made in China 2025 campaign</em>\" roadmap, have been designing their own integrated circuits that they can incorporate into some or all of their products to sell, effectively competing with QCOM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Many of QCOM's customers-cum-competitors do not really like to do business with QCOM. Broadcom (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>) is one of QCOM's customers yet it attempted a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-idUSKBN1D61EO\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-idUSKBN1D61EO\" target=\"_blank\">hostile takeover</a> in 2017. Apple (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) is another example. After AAPL acquired INTC's modem technology in 2019, it has been developing its own modem products and is expected at some point in the future to use its own modem products in some or all of its products rather than QCOM's, though whether that happens or not is anyone's guess (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2022/09/14/5g-modem-development--not-as-easy-as-it-looks-just-ask-apple/?sh=10955f4d4389\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2022/09/14/5g-modem-development--not-as-easy-as-it-looks-just-ask-apple/?sh=10955f4d4389\" target=\"_blank\">developing a modem that meets global Mobile Network Operator certification is tough, even for AAPL</a>).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A Dividend Growth Story No More</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM has a fantastic dividend scorecard from Seeking Alpha that measures its dividend safety, dividend growth, dividend yield and dividend consistency. At an average dividend growth rate of 22.7%, QCOM was a great dividend growth stock. However, the dividend growth rate has slowed down tremendously. The one-year dividend growth rate was just 8.92%, and the forward dividend per share growth is expected to be just 6.23%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811402839523249_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1351\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"> <picture> </picture></a></span><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811402839523249_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1351\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811402839523249.png\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha Dividend Info\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Dividend Info</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Do not get me wrong. I think that a 6.23% dividend growth rate is good; not fantastic but good. But that 6.23% is a little bit of a letdown when compared to its long-term average growth rate, and that 6.23% is even lower than the sector median.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The question is: Can QCOM increase the dividend growth rate again</strong>?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am sure it can. As you can see from the table below, QCOM's dividend growth rate has always fluctuated based on the fortunes of the company. During the boom period (2004-2007) before the Great Financial Crisis, the company increased dividends at an astonishing rate. During the few years of and after the Great Financial Crisis (2008-2011), the dividend growth rate slowed significantly as the recession hit demand and pushed down earnings.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/18/50001627-1681856420987403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"870\" data-height=\"815\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/18/50001627-1681856420987403.png\" alt=\"QCOM annual dividend growth rate and payout ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>QCOM annual dividend growth rate and payout ratio</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When earnings picked up during the up-cycle from 2012 to 2015, the company increased the dividend growth rate again in the mouth-watering double digits. The down-cycle from 2016 to 2021 was definitely a period that tested the patience of dividend growth investors when dividend growth was reduced greatly from 12.22% to just <strong>2.42%</strong> at one point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Will this down-cycle continue? Perhaps for the rest of the year. In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574897-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574897-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q1 2023 earnings call</a>, the CEO shared his view of the next few months,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>As the handset industry continues to experience reduced demand, we are now expecting elevated channel inventory levels to persist at least through the first half of calendar \u201823. In addition, multiple end industries within IoT are also experiencing weaker-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Akash Palkhiwala added more color with this,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The environment continues to be dynamic with challenging macroeconomic conditions and COVID headwinds in China, driving industry-wide demand weakness. Given this uncertainty, we are incorporating a negative bias for 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes for calendar \u201823 relative to calendar \u201822.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is my view that due to the down-cycle that the industry is currently facing, QCOM will remain prudent with its cash and slow down the dividend growth rate in FY 2023. Investors expecting double-digit dividend growth in QCOM in 2023 will likely be disappointed. If history is any indication, once QCOM enters the up-cycle, and earnings start to improve, the growth in dividends should increase as well. But till that happens, the dividend growth story is dead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A big price decline means a larger margin of safety but it may not mean the stock is cheap; price is not an indication of valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on just the price-to-earnings ratio, QCOM is by far the cheapest company in this basket of stocks.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-16821575096043978_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"846\" data-height=\"235\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-16821575096043978.png\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha Valuation Comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Valuation Comparison</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on most of the valuation metrics below, QCOM is cheaper than the sector median.

This period is chosen to reflect the down-cycle that QCOM experienced as well as to remove the anomalies caused by supply chain disruptions and semiconductor chips shortage as a result of the pandemic that led to the unsustainable surge in earnings growth from 2020 to 2022. If QCOM can trade back to this normal P/E of around 15, this investment can potentially yield a total annualized rate of return of <strong>11.02% by 2026</strong>, and that is including the possibility of a decline in adjusted operating earnings in 2025 and 2026.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-16821582108098526_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1325\" data-height=\"722\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/22/50001627-16821582108098526.png\" alt=\"Fast Graph QCOM Forecasting Calculator\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fast Graph QCOM Forecasting Calculator</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm is a leader in the semiconductor industry with a market cap of $132 billion. This A-credit-rated company boasts a strong balance sheet and an improving net income margin from 11.06% to 29.38% in just 5 years. It has outperformed the S&amp;P over a 20-year period, rewarding patient shareholders with an 1126% gain with dividends reinvested. QCOM has also paid a growing dividend for 19 years, increasing the dividends at an average rate of 22.7%, and with its commitment to continue to repurchase shares and its continual efforts to diversify its revenue streams into multiple growth areas with huge total addressable markets like automotive, IoT, cloud infrastructure, edge computing, data center, and computing, the company is poised to keep growing its earnings and revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There are short-term headwinds facing the company, namely the decline in handset sales, its largest revenue segment, which started in 2022 and is expected to last way into 2023, will be a drag on revenue. Subsequent earnings may not be great. Management's guidance for Q2 2023 is sobering,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.7 billion to $9.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to $2.25. The midpoint of our guidance includes <strong>an assumption of lower end market demand</strong> and the <strong>continued drawdown of channel inventory</strong>. We are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion and EBT margins of 66% to 70%, reflecting a sequential seasonal <strong>decline in handset units</strong>. In QCT, we estimate revenues of $7.4 billion to $8 billion and EBT margins of 25% to 27%. We expect <strong>handsets</strong> and <strong>automotive revenue to be flat</strong> sequentially, <strong>offset by a reduction in IoT revenues</strong> due to the factors I just outlined.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These are among the main reasons spooking investors into avoiding QCOM. To add to that is the revenue concentration risk QCOM has in China; <strong>63.6%</strong> of QCOM's 2022 revenue originates from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, when the markets QCOM is selling to have strong, long-term growth trends, be it coming from the increasing global middle-income population that will demand more modern goods like smartphones, smart home devices, and better driving experiences with driver assistance technologies, <strong>or</strong> coming from QCOM's penetration into emerging markets like AI processing, edge computing, and data centers, I believe that the short term sales decline will reverse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Well-known fund managers certainly also think that the QCOM is worth investing in. In Q3 and Q4 of 2022, while the data on declining handset sales are coming in, scaring everybody and QCOM's stock price was falling, investors the likes of Ray Dalio, Joel Greenblatt, Jeremy Grantham, Jim Simons, Ken Fisher, Steven Cohen, and Mario Gabelli collectively poured <a href=\"https://stockcircle.com/stocks/qcom\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://stockcircle.com/stocks/qcom\" target=\"_blank\">more than half a billion dollars</a> into QCOM.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/10/50001627-16811371231471417.png\" alt=\"Figures collated from Stockcircle\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figures collated from Stockcircle</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investors must know that there are two sides to every story. <strong>QCOM's story is not a straightforward one</strong> of \"<em>it is a dividend growth stock that has increased dividends for 19 years</em>\", \"<em>it is a mature tech company that pays an above market rate dividend yield of 2.53%</em>\", or \"<em>it is a safe stock with a solid credit rating that can preserve my capital during a recession</em>\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>QCOM is more of a value-investor play now than it is a dividend growth stock or income stock, and the story with QCOM is an undervalued stock that is caught in a short-term down-cycle, and once the cycle swings up shareholders will be rewarded.</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What do you think?</p> <div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display: none;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\"> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\"> </div> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\"> </div> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\"> </div> </div></div>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm: There Are Two Sides To Every Story. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595771-qualcomm-there-are-two-sides-to-every-story?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "106432", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "449239", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1168", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "614296", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115452", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "606619", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "603709", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4595771-qualcomm-there-are-two-sides-to-every-story", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595771-qualcomm-there-are-two-sides-to-every-story", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379869/image_1390379869.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379869/image_1390379869.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379869/image_1390379869.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379869/image_1390379869.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "106432", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "james-long", "userId": 50001627, "tagId": 614296, "bio": "<p>I am a conservative yet opportunistic value investor who has been investing since 2005.
