[<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/qualcomm-ceo-says-planning-for-apple-to-make-own-iphone-modems-from-2024-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/qualcomm-ceo-says-planning-for-apple-to-make-own-iphone-modems-from-2024-.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>]</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a result of the steep top/ bottom line cliff ahead, we are uncertain about QCOM's mixed prospects in the near term, since the <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-market-declines-eighth-quarter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-market-declines-eighth-quarter/\" target=\"_blank\">global smartphone market's sell-through</a> continues to decline QoQ/ YoY for the eighth consecutive quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While much of the pessimism may have been priced in, we do not think that the semi company's IoT and Automotive segments' performance may be able to balance the handset headwinds in the intermediate term. This is why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM's IoT revenues have been underwhelming at $1.48B (+6.4% QoQ/ -23.7% YoY) for now, likely attributed to the ongoing cloud capex optimization from the peak recessionary fears and prolonged inventory draw down from the hyper pandemic heights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The same has been observed in the semi company's elevated inventory levels of $6.62B (-3.3% QoQ/ +22.3% YoY) in FQ3'23, compared to FY2021 levels of $3.22B (+24.3% YoY) and FY2019 levels of $1.4B (-17.1% YoY).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">QCOM's performance in the automotive segment remains uncertain as well, despite the growing revenues of $434M (-2.9% QoQ/ +12.7% YoY) in the latest quarter and last reported <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552281-qualcomm-inc-qcom-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552281-qualcomm-inc-qcom-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">ADAS design win pipeline</a> of over $30B in FQ4'22.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The semi company will have to contend with Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) DRIVE Orin's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607199-nvidia-corp-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607199-nvidia-corp-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">expanding automotive pipeline of $14B</a> (+27.2% YoY) and accelerating quarterly revenues of $296M (+1% QoQ/ +114% YoY) in Q1'23. Given NVDA's supposed lead in generative AI and other SaaS segments, there is a good chance that the automotive SaaS market may remain intensely competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, while QCOM may have formed great partnerships with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) on generative AI works, it remains to be seen how much contribution they may make to the former's top and bottom lines in the near-term, due to the underwhelming commentary (highlighted in bold for emphasis) from the management in the recent earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>As we approach fiscal '24, our revenue growth will <strong>largely depend on macroeconomic environment, global handset units, and China recovery</strong>... In addition, we expect a <strong>sequential decline in IoT and automotive revenues</strong>, consistent with the seasonal trend we've seen in the last couple of years... Until we see sustained signs of improving fundamentals, <strong>our operating framework does not assume an immediate recovery</strong>.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While we applaud the management's painful transparency, we believe it may be more prudent to monitor the situation a little longer before jumping in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <strong>So, Is QCOM Stock A Buy</strong><strong>, Sell, or Hold?</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>QCOM 5Y EV/Revenue and P/E Valuations</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/8/54998043-16915389544848592_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"944\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/8/54998043-16915389544848592.png\" alt=\"QCOM 5Y EV/Revenue and P/E Valuations\" width=\"640\" height=\"273\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"273\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">S&amp;P Capital IQ</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For now, QCOM is still trading rather optimistically at NTM EV/ Revenues of 3.88x and NTM P/E of 13.83x, compared to its 1Y mean of 3.59x/ 11.98x, while nearing its 3Y pre-pandemic mean of 3.52x/ 16.74x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is because the semi company's top and bottom line recovery have yet to fully materialize, with its valuations and stock price recovery very much pulled forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on QCOM's forward guidance of FY2023 EPS of $8.29 (-33.8% YoY) at the midpoint and its NTM valuations, our near-term price target of $118.38 has been fully baked in as well, suggesting minimal upside potential from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the semi company's prospects may recover over the next few years, we believe any pessimistic news may also trigger further volatility in its stock prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>QCOM 3Y Stock Price</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/8/54998043-16915389763560662_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1363\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/8/54998043-16915389763560662.png\" alt=\"QCOM 3Y Stock Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"375\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TradingView</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We have already seen the QCOM stock experience a dramatic pullback by over -10% post FQ3'23 earnings call, thanks to the sobering forward commentary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the stock appears to be well supported at current levels, we maintain our belief that the stock's recovery has been too fast and furious since the May 2023 bottom, likely lifted by the supposed bull run market since the start of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With its prospects unlikely to lift in the near term, we do not recommend anyone to add QCOM here.
