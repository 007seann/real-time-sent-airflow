So let's call the first two a wash and consider this a 15% net stink call thus far. Not our finest hour, but 15% isn't irrecoverable in this name in our view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company reported its Q4 of FY9/23 Wednesday after the close. So where does it stand now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Well, we believe it to be buy-able and we rate the stock at Accumulate. And here's why.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm Stock - Fundamental Analysis And Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Here are the numbers up to and including this quarter just printed.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/1/40844025-16988857903816042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3170\" data-height=\"1842\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/1/40844025-16988857903816042.png\" alt=\"QCOM Fundamentals\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM Fundamentals <span>(Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revenue isn't pretty - still in decline (-24% this quarter, and -19% on a TTM basis). And accounting earnings, which we measure using EBITDA, also aren't so hot. TTM EBITDA of $12bn is way down from the recent TTM high of $20bn struck as recently as the September 2022 quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Where things get more interesting is cash flow, leverage, and valuation multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">TTM unlevered pretax free cash flow stands at $11.4bn right now, which (1) is more or less the same as EBITDA, telling you that the EBITDA is high quality earnings, and (2) a recent high - only the June 2021 quarter came close to that mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a result of all this cash generation, net leverage now sits at just 0.3x TTM EBITDA, down from 0.6x only two quarters back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And valuation sits at just 11.7x TTM UFCF, 11.0x TTM EBITDA or 3.7x TTM revenue. They aren't big multiples.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/1/40844025-169888675708813.png\" alt=\"QCOM Valuation Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM Valuation Analysis <span>(Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company is guiding to flat growth for Q1 of FY9/24 (that's the December 2023 quarter) which would be a significant milestone if achieved. And this we believe is why the stock turned up today on the print. On the face of it the story isn't so hot - but something got investors excited, and it wasn't a modest beat that did it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm Technical Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Here's the chart as we see it.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/1/40844025-16988871399590688_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1975\" data-height=\"1177\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/1/40844025-16988871399590688.png\" alt=\"QCOM Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM Chart <span>(Cestrian Capital Research, TrendSpider)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The stock has tested and re-tested support in the region of the .618 Fibonacci retrace of the whole move up from the 2019 lows to the 2021 highs - call it $101-107/share as strong support. Support at such a retracement level is common for a Wave Two low; and if that was a Wave Two low then the next big move is likely, up.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm Stock Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on the volume x price profile - that's the gray bars on the right hand side that indicate the price zones in which big and small volumes are traded - we rate QCOM at \"Accumulate\" between $105-$122/share. And we think it's capable of running up significantly from there, perhaps to prior all-time highs and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, neither our best nor our worst calls so far, we now flag QCOM as an Accumulate opportunity - we'll see you in a quarter's time to see how this idea aged.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 1 November 2023. </em></p>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm: A Buy On Fundamentals And Technicals Alike. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4646443-qualcomm-a-buy-on-fundamentals-and-technicals-alike?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1221\"><strong>GET INSTITUTIONAL GRADE BUYSIDE RESEARCH FROM CESTRIAN CAPITAL RESEARCH</strong></a></p><p>We provide investment research prepared to institutional investor quality, presented in a way anyone can understand.\u00a0 Our work allows you to make sense of company fundamentals and stock technicals without resort to jargon or esoterica.
