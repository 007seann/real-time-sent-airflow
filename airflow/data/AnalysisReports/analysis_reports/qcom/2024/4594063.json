Moreover, the remarkable surge in semi-stocks in 2023 has normalized the sector's valuations, with NVDA well in the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589899-nvidia-dont-be-the-last-greater-fool\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589899-nvidia-dont-be-the-last-greater-fool\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">overvalued zone</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As such, investors who failed to capitalize on semiconductor stocks in late December or early January, as they feared a deeper economic recession, could be in FOMO mode now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The iShares adjusted P/E has reverted to 22.2x, closer to its 10Y average of 24.6x. It's also pretty close to QCOM's peers' median of 20.5x (according to S&amp;P Cap IQ), suggesting there could still be bargains in the market if you know where to find them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm doesn't have significant exposure to US cloud computing leaders, so it has not benefited from AI training and inference chips tailwinds that saw AMD, NVDA, and INTC stock outperforming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moreover, investors are likely <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230411PD205.html?mod=2&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=member-daily-newsletter\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230411PD205.html?mod=2&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=member-daily-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">disappointed</a> by the recent performance of Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>), as it was hampered by the massive memory downcycle, putting further pressure on its bid to recover its operating profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moreover, China's consumer spending remains relatively weak, even though China's central bank is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/pboc-s-yi-says-china-to-achieve-gdp-target-property-improving?srnd=premium\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/pboc-s-yi-says-china-to-achieve-gdp-target-property-improving?srnd=premium\" target=\"_blank\">confident</a> that the government will achieve its 5% GDP growth target. Hence, the prospects of an H2 recovery remain in the works, suggesting Qualcomm should see a better H2CY2023, helping to lift sentiments in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But why are investors still so concerned with its smartphone malaise, even though the company has diversified into other growth segments, including automotive and IoT?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A sum-of-the-parts, or SOTP, valuation framework by Trefis could provide some clues into how the market is thinking. Accordingly, Trefis indicates that <a href=\"https://www.trefis.com/company?hm=QCOM.trefis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.trefis.com/company?hm=QCOM.trefis\" target=\"_blank\">QCOM's mobile device chipsets</a> segment accounts for 78% of its valuation, with 21.6% from QTL licensing. As such, while the automotive pipeline offers optionality for Qualcomm in the medium- to long-term, near-term sentiments are likely still dominated by its performance in its smartphone segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moreover, Morningstar's assessment of a <a href=\"https://investor.morningstar.com/quotes/0P000004J4\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.morningstar.com/quotes/0P000004J4\" target=\"_blank\">narrow</a> economic moat rating is predicated mainly on its licensing division, as Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) attempts to navigate its way out of Qualcomm's modem business by 2025. However, we assessed analysts have likely reflected the downside from Apple's potential exit, as it's no longer new information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The revised analysts' estimates remain relatively downbeat, as they expect Qualcomm to post a revenue decline of 18.3% YoY in FQ2'23 after last quarter's 11.6% drop. However, it's expected to mark the bottom in Qualcomm's revenue trajectory, with the company expected to finish FY23 (year ending September 2023) with a revenue decline of 14.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm's prospects are likely tied closely to China's H2 recovery, as it was the <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-premium-smartphone-market-outlook-bright-future-ahead/#:~:text=With%20over%201%20billion%20smartphone,above%20RMB%204%2C000%20in%202022%29.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-premium-smartphone-market-outlook-bright-future-ahead/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter13Apr2023&amp;utm_source=Counterpoint+Research+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=b5327144a5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_08_06_11_19_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_0c8d75a0f8-b5327144a5-88304953\" target=\"_blank\">second-largest</a> smartphone market in the world in 2022. As such, Qualcomm's premium positioning in China will likely be critical to help maintain its competitive edge, even as its mass-market peers attempt to capture share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite that, Qualcomm is also not standing still, as DIGITIMES reported recently that MediaTek (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDTKF\" title=\"MediaTek Inc.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:MDTKF</a>) is reportedly facing \"<a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230410PD217/chips+components-guidance-ic-design-revenue.html?mod=3&amp;q=QUALCOMM\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230410PD217/chips+components-guidance-ic-design-revenue.html?mod=3&amp;q=QUALCOMM\" target=\"_blank\">increased rivalry</a> from Qualcomm in the midrange segment.\" As such, the company remains well-positioned to navigate the headwinds in the smartphone segment, which could bottom out in H1CY2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The critical question is: does the market agree? We believe so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/13/51630113-1681440527701589_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1575\" data-height=\"837\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/4/13/51630113-1681440527701589.png\" alt=\"QCOM price chart (weekly)\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM price chart (weekly) (TradingView)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575851-qualcomm-stock-dont-miss-buying-next-pullback\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575851-qualcomm-stock-dont-miss-buying-next-pullback\" target=\"_blank\">downgraded</a> QCOM in early February before the pullback, as we saw potential consolidation in its price action.
