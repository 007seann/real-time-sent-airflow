(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), and I have to admit that my error in selling at that time was incorrect and largely due to getting so many darn proxy forms in the mail. The Qualcomm side wanted us to nominate their board choices and Broadcom had a different roster in mind. Millions must have been wasted on paper, they were coming every week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Years afterward, Qualcomm popped back up on my radar after being a consistent stock that appeared on Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula screener. This is a screener that hunts for high earnings yields and high returns on invested capital. The screener doesn't score them for you, but rather gives you the top 30-50. After scoring Qualcomm myself, it's apparent that they are a buy and one of the cheapest chip stocks you can get your hands on at this moment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What they do</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6998016#QCOM-20220925_HTM_i9ad6dd4fe99344baa66ed135956810b0_19\">Most recent financial year 10-K:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p>We are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless technologies and processor technologies including high-performance, low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence [AI] technologies.

Certainly what we expect to see in the cyclical sector of semiconductors outside of the steady eddy materials suppliers like Applied Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT\" title=\"Applied Materials, Inc.\">AMAT</a>) or Lam Research (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX\" title=\"Lam Research Corporation\">LRCX</a>). As Peter Lynch pointed out, the best time to get into cyclicals is when their engines have been revved down to the lowest point at the bottom of their cycle. If history holds, they'll bounce back again when the economy is back on an upswing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The most important factor for cyclicals is balance sheet management and reserving growth spending for the right timing. As we'll see below, Qualcomm does a great job with its balance sheet, maintaining positive free cash flow where other large players like Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) could not as they undergo excessive capex at the bottom of a cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm is one of the most prominent cellular phone chip designers and receives royalty income from all that incorporate their chips. These run the spectrum of 3G, 4G, and 5G chipsets. The ubiquitous snapdragon chip has been very successful, but other phone manufacturers have sought to create their own chips as well. Diversification into other chipsets and industries is wisely being pursued in case their moat in mobile devices deteriorates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The chart</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/4/saupload_ffafd6fbc8c131651e0eddb0c880941b.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">37.8% off the high? You've got to love it. These are the charts I look for in companies that are still profitable and just in a bit of a funk due to recent headwinds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ROIC - Return on invested capital</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Effective management should be able to produce ample ROIC, or return on invested capital. Let's pick apart Qualcomm's ROIC:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>All data in millions courtesy of Seeking Alpha</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's take a look at the two using the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>NOPAT (net operating income after taxes)/total LT + ST borrowings + total equity, aka \"invested capital\".</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>NOPAT = TTM EBIT of 12,692 X (1-11.2%)= <strong>11,270</strong> </li> <li>Short term debt= 4,433</li> <li>Long term debt = 15,486</li> <li>Total equity capital= 19,698</li> <li>Total invested capital= <strong>39,617</strong> </li> <li>NOPAT (11,270)/Invested capital (39,617)= <strong>28.4% ROIC</strong> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Magic formula score</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula is a good scoring system to find cheap stocks by both \"good\", defined as having a high ROIC, and \"cheap\" defined as having a high earnings yield.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>TTM EBIT/EV= 11.05, 1/11.05= <strong>9% earnings yield.</strong> </li> <li>9 + 28.4 = <strong>37.4 Magic formula score</strong> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For cyclical stocks, we cannot apply a discount model based on the risk-free rate utilizing owner earnings. The reason is that we should expect their earnings to always be lumpy, not steady growth with inflation. PEG ratios can be useful when a cyclical is at its midpoint cycle, but useless at the bottom. I like using the magic formula score in these instances as it gives us an internal look at management effectiveness combined with how cheap it is on an earnings yield basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A score above 20 is solid. Anything near 40 should be looked at as cheap.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dividend</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/6/29/55355197-16880655833796802_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1610\" data-height=\"984\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/6/29/55355197-16880655833796802.jpg\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha div Qcom\" width=\"640\" height=\"391\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"391\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company pays a very solid, well-covered dividend.

The last 10 years of price performance have resulted in a price percent change of 82.14%. This is the price appreciation over the decade versus total return. Matching this return in the next decade would get us back to the all-time high and then some. Going from $60 to $120 in 10 years is a CAGR of 7.17% per year.

Some of these royalties are sticky and should be ongoing. There has been a significant increase in revenues in this category from 21' to 22', so the narrative that every phone manufacturer will, or can go the route of Apple may be overblown. However, this is the most prescient risk narrative sprinkled throughout the Qualcomm 10-K.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is a cheap stock being mispriced in a cyclical downturn. The balance sheet is great. Buybacks have been generous. The dividend is substantial and well-covered.
