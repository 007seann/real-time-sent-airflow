EPS missed by a whisker while revenue beat by a healthy $150 Million.

But I'll try.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><li>Qualcomm CDMA Technologies' (\"QCT\") overall revenue declined by 17% YoY but the lone bright spot was that the Automotive segment grew by 20% as shown below. This is key as the Total Addressable Market (\"TAM\") for Automotive is <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2022/09/qualcomm-s-automotive-design-win-pipeline-expands-to--30-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2022/09/qualcomm-s-automotive-design-win-pipeline-expands-to--30-billion\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to reach $100 Billion by 2030.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/4/1003408-16831941659218123.png\" alt=\"QCOM Automotive\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM Automotive (Investors.qualcomm.com)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Operating expenses came in below the company's guidance by almost $80 Million. In an environment where demand and inflation are going in the wrong direction, Qualcomm reigning in on the expenses is a good sign. In the event that things get uglier, I fully expect Qualcomm to get even more disciplined with its expenses.</li> <li>Qualcomm was already trading at a relatively cheaper valuation compared to most of its industry peers. This sell-off has made the stock even more attractive for the value and bargain hunters (as covered in the conclusion below). There is little doubt that the short-to-medium term will be rough for investors but Qualcomm's cyclical nature is well documented. I personally recall investing in such lows in the past that I made 2x or 3x within a year or two when things recovered.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bad</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><li>I might as well say the entire Q2 was bad and move on.

The current price of $105 is a good 15% below the 200-Day moving average and this suggests a new low is likely to be established. Given recent numbers from industry peers like Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), I don't think analysts will be rushing to Qualcomm's aid here and the stock is likely to weaken further over the next few days.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/4/1003408-16831936832867892.png\" alt=\"QCOM Moving Averages\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QCOM Moving Averages (Barchart.com)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Ugly</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><li>I was in a dilemma about whether this belongs in the \"Ugly\" or the \"Bad\" but given the <a href=\"https://investor.qualcomm.com/segments/qct#:~:text=QCT%20%28Qualcomm%20CDMA%20Technologies%29%20develops,devices%20and%20automotive%20systems%20for\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://investor.qualcomm.com/segments/qct#:~:text=QCT%20%28Qualcomm%20CDMA%20Technologies%29%20develops,devices%20and%20automotive%20systems%20for\" target=\"_blank\">importance</a> of this segment, this belongs here. QCT weakness in Q2 and expected weakness going forward was highlighted by the company many times on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3965046-qualcomms-outlook-falls-short-ceo-cites-challenging-mobile-phone-market\">earnings release and call</a>.</li></ul> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p><em>Additionally, Qualcomm (QCOM) said it expects to see \"a larger-than-normal\" sequential decline in revenue for its QCT division, which includes most of the company's mobile-phone chipsets and other mobile device products.\"</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What is more telling is that Qualcomm (nor anyone) has any idea or control over when it will get better. Why do I say so? Because as the company stated \"<em>macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units, and channel inventory drawdown</em>\" are affecting the demand. Basically, the whole world, Qualcomm's private world, and their house are all contributing to this. The silver-lining may be the fact that the company said the projected QCT weakness is at least partially attributable to the timing of purchase by a customer. In other words, delayed but not denied?</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Quarterly Free Cash Flow (\"FCF\") <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/16556800/qualcomms-nasdaqqcom-q2-sales-top-estimates-but-quarterly-guidance-underwhelms#:~:text=Qualcomm%20%28QCOM%29%20Q2%20FY2023%20Highlights%3A&amp;text=Free%20cash%20flow%20was%20negative,58.4%25%20same%20quarter%20last%20year\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/16556800/qualcomms-nasdaqqcom-q2-sales-top-estimates-but-quarterly-guidance-underwhelms#:~:text=Qualcomm%20%28QCOM%29%20Q2%20FY2023%20Highlights%3A&amp;text=Free%20cash%20flow%20was%20negative,58.4%25%20same%20quarter%20last%20year\" target=\"_blank\">went down</a> from $2.7 Billion to -$486 Million YoY. To get a perspective of how rare this, Qualcomm has reported negative FCF in just five other quarters <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/free_cash_flow\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/free_cash_flow\" target=\"_blank\">going back to</a> 2010. History suggests this is unlikely to be a trend but it is important to keep an eye on this number as the company just <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585809-qualcomm-stock-2023-dividend-increase-undervalued\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585809-qualcomm-stock-2023-dividend-increase-undervalued\" target=\"_blank\">recently</a> increased its dividend payment to 80 cents a quarter. That means, on average, Qualcomm needs to generate about $900 Million in quarterly FCF just to cover its dividend commitment based on <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/shares_outstanding\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/shares_outstanding\" target=\"_blank\">total share count</a> of 1.115 Billion. That said, given the company's dividend growth <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/scorecard\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/dividends/scorecard\" target=\"_blank\">history</a>, and overall strong balance sheet, dividend coverage is the least of my worries right now</li> <li>More than the Q2 numbers, I believe Q3's guidance hurt the stock more. Qualcomm's revenue guidance of $8.1 B to $8.9 Billion was well short of the expected $9.12 Billion. Similarly, the guided EPS range between $1.70 and $1.90 was once again well short of the expected $2.13 per share.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, where does the stock go immediately? Hard to say. But, as someone who has followed Qualcomm for a very long time, I can say this. Qualcomm is a cyclical company, there are no two ways about it. When the light shines on them, they are the brightest and the market loves them. When things turn down a bit, the market tends to beat then down much worse than the competitors get beat. But there are enough compelling reasons to stay invested with Qualcomm here. I may be tempted to add should the stock go below $100, which would push the yield well past 3%. If 2024 EPS <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM/analysis?p=QCOM\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM/analysis?p=QCOM\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> hold true, the stock is trading at a forward multiple of about 9.</p>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm Q2: Weak But I Am Staying. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599840-qualcomm-q2-weak-but-im-staying?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "25319", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "454039", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1168", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "35889", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4599840-qualcomm-q2-weak-but-im-staying", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599840-qualcomm-q2-weak-but-im-staying", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "25319", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "tradevestor", "userId": 1003408, "tagId": 35889, "bio": "<p>Dividends (DGI and DRIP) and Growth at reasonable price (GARP) for Long-term.
