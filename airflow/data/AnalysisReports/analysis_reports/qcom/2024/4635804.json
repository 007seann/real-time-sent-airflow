We projected net margins to reach 31.3% by 2027. As a fabless chipmaker, we believe it benefits from an improving<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> asset turnover ratio. Despite the failed NXP takeover, Qualcomm prioritized share buybacks over debt repayment, boosting its financial leverage and ROA. Overall, we expected Qualcomm to maintain these strategies, enhancing ROE for shareholders.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In this analysis, we assessed the company's sustainability of growth by examining its segments: Handsets, Automotive, and IoT. In 2023, the company integrated its previous RFFE segment into these three segments, adjusting historical segment revenue accordingly. We calculated a -16.4% total growth based on prorated revenues from Q1 to Q3 in 2023, a notable contrast to its strong performance in 2021 and 2022. To gauge Qualcomm's potential for recovery and sustainability, we delved into each segment's 2023 deceleration and projected their growth beyond that year. Finally, we updated our valuation using a DCF analysis.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Revenue Breakdown ($ mln)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2019</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2020</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2021</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Handset</p></td> <td><p>11,089</p></td> <td><p>12,533</p></td> <td><p>20,477</p></td> <td><p>28,825</p></td> <td><p>22,819</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>13.0%</p></td> <td><p>63.4%</p></td> <td><p>40.8%</p></td> <td><p>-20.8%</p></td> <td><p>24.1%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Automotive</p></td> <td><p>684</p></td> <td><p>714</p></td> <td><p>1,098</p></td> <td><p>1,500</p></td> <td><p>1,783</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>4.4%</p></td> <td><p>53.8%</p></td> <td><p>36.6%</p></td> <td><p>18.8%</p></td> <td><p>28.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>IoT</p></td> <td><p>2,866</p></td> <td><p>3,246</p></td> <td><p>5,443</p></td> <td><p>7,351</p></td> <td><p>6,076</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>13.3%</p></td> <td><p>67.7%</p></td> <td><p>35.1%</p></td> <td><p>-17.3%</p></td> <td><p>24.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>QTL</p></td> <td><p>4,591</p></td> <td><p>5,028</p></td> <td><p>6,320</p></td> <td><p>6,358</p></td> <td><p>6,081</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>9.5%</p></td> <td><p>25.7%</p></td> <td><p>0.6%</p></td> <td><p>-4.4%</p></td> <td><p>7.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>QSI</p></td> <td><p>152</p></td> <td><p>36</p></td> <td><p>45</p></td> <td><p>31</p></td> <td><p>31</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>-76.3%</p></td> <td><p>25.0%</p></td> <td><p>-31.1%</p></td> <td><p>-1.1%</p></td> <td><p>-20.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Reconciling items</p></td> <td><p>4,891</p></td> <td><p>1,974</p></td> <td><p>182</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>153.3</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p><strong>Total</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>24,273</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>23,531</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>33,566</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>44,200</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>36,943</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p><strong>Growth %</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>-3.1%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>42.6%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>31.7%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>-16.4%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>13.7%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Handset Segment</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Firstly, for the Handset segment, which is the largest segment of the company accounting for 65% of revenues in 2022, the segment's growth accelerated in 2021 with a strong performance as it grew by 63.4%. However, its growth had slowed down in 2022 but was still above its 4-year average. However, based on the prorated Q1 to Q3 2023 segment results, we derived a growth rate of -20.8% for the segment in 2023 which is well below its 4-year average. Overall, the segment has a strong past average growth but slowed down and we forecasted to decline in 2023. Based on the table below, we believe the company's performance in 2023 was affected by the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/728644/quarterly-global-smartphone-shipments-by-quarter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">smartphone market</a> weakness where the pace of declines accelerated in Q4 2022 and was down 14.5% in Q1 2023 before improving to -7.2%.

Moreover, for shipments growth, we forecasted this based on our premium smartphone market (&gt;$600) shipment growth forecasted which we assumed its share of total shipments to increase from 21% in 2022 (by 2% per year but tapered down by 0.3% per year) to 29% by 2027 as we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4512456-qualcomm-still-has-the-edge-over-mediatek\">previously</a> identified that Qualcomm targets the premium smartphone market segment.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm Handset Projections ($ mln)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2021</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2024F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2025F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2026F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2027F</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>ASP Increase %</p></td> <td><p>8.4%</p></td> <td><p>5.6%</p></td> <td><p>3.4%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Unit Shipment Increase %</p></td> <td><p>50.7%</p></td> <td><p>33.2%</p></td> <td><p>-23.4%</p></td> <td><p>10.5%</p></td> <td><p>8.5%</p></td> <td><p>6.8%</p></td> <td><p>5.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Handset Revenues</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>20,477</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>28,825</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>22,819</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>25,785</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>28,603</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>31,240</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>33,663</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Total Growth %</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>63.4%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>40.8%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>-20.8%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>13.0%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10.9%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>9.2%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>7.8%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Counterpoint Research, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, we projected Qualcomm's Handset segment to grow at a forward average of 4% and a sustainable growth rate of 7.8% from 2027. Although our forecasted sustainable growth rate of 7.8% is lower than its past 4-year average of 24.1%, it is still higher compared to the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266973/global-semiconductor-sales-since-1988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">semicon market</a> growth which grew at a 10-year average of 6.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thus, we believe that the company's growth in Handset could be sustainable due to Qualcomm's leadership in the premium smartphone segment which it dominates in terms of market share as highlighted in our previous analysis. We expect Qualcomm to capitalize on its leadership to benefit from the high premium smartphone market segment growth. However, we expect it is unlikely to experience the high past growth based on its 3-year average of 39% as the share of 5G increase slowdown as adoption increased rapidly with the introduction of 5G in 2019. Moreover, Qualcomm only plans to <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/11/its-2022-and-were-already-thinking-about-the-evolution-of-5g-advanced-to-6g\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduce</a> 6G technologies by 2030, thus we believe it would not benefit from significant ASP gains until then.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Automotive Segment</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm's automotive segment has been rapidly growing in the past 4 years with an average of 28.4%, higher compared to its Handset and IoT segment. Its growth rate accelerated in 2021 but slowed down to 37% in 2022. Moreover, the automotive segment experienced a slowdown to 29.9% in 2023 on a prorated basis from Q1 to Q3 2023. In our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631565-tsmc-short-term-market-weakness-long-term-gain\">previous analysis</a> of TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>), we highlighted the automotive market unit sales slowed down in Q1 2023 and projected annual sales for 2023 at a prorated 57.95 mln, indicating a -0.34% growth rate. Similar to the PC and smartphone markets, the automotive market has seen increased inventory levels, suggesting weakened demand which we believed was due to the deteriorating consumer confidence at the start of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on its previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599640-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings briefing</a>, Qualcomm highlighted global automakers are adopting its Snapdragon digital chassis, including a partnership with Mercedes-Benz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBGAF\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz Group AG\">OTCPK:MBGAF</a>). Recently, the company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4623041-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a> that it had secured over 10 new designs for its automotive platform with automakers. Furthermore, according to the company, its <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2022/09/qualcomm-s-automotive-design-win-pipeline-expands-to--30-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\">automotive pipeline</a> has continued to grow significantly to $30 bln at the end of 2022 which is a huge increase of 131%. Thus, we believe the company's outlook for the automotive segment remains solid despite the near-term slowdown as its pipeline growth has accelerated.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Automotive Pipeline Design wins ($ bln)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2019</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2020</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2021</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Pipeline Design</p></td> <td><p>6.50</p></td> <td><p>8</p></td> <td><p>13</p></td> <td><p>30</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>23.1%</p></td> <td><p>62.5%</p></td> <td><p>130.8%</p></td> <td><p>72.1%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm Automotive Segment Revenue ($ mln)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2024F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2025F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2026F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2027F</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Automotive</p></td> <td><p>1,500</p></td> <td><p>1,783</p></td> <td><p>2,116</p></td> <td><p>2,512</p></td> <td><p>2,981</p></td> <td><p>3,539</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td><p>36.6%</p></td> <td><p>18.8%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We projected Qualcomm's growth in 2023 based on its prorated Q1 to Q3 segment results. Moreover, beyond 2023, we projected the segment's growth based on the ADAS market CAGR of 18.7% by <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/08/2623586/0/en/Advanced-Driver-Assistance-Systems-Market-Size-Growing-at-18-7-CAGR-Set-to-Reach-USD-90-1-Billion-By-2030.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acumen Research</a>. Overall, we forecasted the company's sustainable growth rate at 18.7% based on the ADAS market forecast CAGR. Our growth forecast is lower compared with the segment's 4-year average of 28.4%. Notwithstanding, this growth is 4 times higher compared to the semicon market growth at a 10-year average of 6.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe the company's automotive segment growth could be sustainable supported by the ADAS market growth as highlighted in our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4458577-top-3-automotive-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy\">previous analysis</a> with the technological evolution for increasing vehicle automation features to support greater vehicle driverless assistance. Moreover, according to <a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/2023-08-03+Q3+FY23+Investor+Presentation.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8b8929a7c60189b7463b5400a5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infineon</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IFNNF\" title=\"Infineon Technologies AG\">OTCQX:IFNNF</a>), the share of Level 1 to 2 ADAS is expected to increase from 50% to 65% of total vehicles from 2021 to 2027 whereas the share of Level 3 to 5 is projected to reach 5% from 0% in 2021. Additionally, its design pipeline has continuously grown in the past 3 years with partnerships with top automakers globally which we believe could further support its growth outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>IoT Segment</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the final segment, Qualcomm's IoT segment similarly had accelerating growth in 2021 but slowed down in 2022. The segment's 4-year average growth of 25.7% is the second highest behind its automotive segment. However, we prorated its Q1 to Q3 revenues which indicates a contraction of 12.6% in 2023. According to Qualcomm, the IoT segment experienced elevated channel inventory due to decreased demand influenced by broader macroeconomic weakness based on its latest earnings briefing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore, the company guided that uncertainty surrounding the timing of a consistent recovery and cautious customer purchasing behavior could affect its near-term outlook due to the excess inventory levels for its IoT segment products. However, Qualcomm continued to highlight its developments in consumer IoT such as Dell's <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/dell-inspiron-14-arm-based-laptop-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">release</a> of a laptop powered by Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2. Also, the new Snapdragon Compute platform with custom Orion CPUs and AI acceleration is set for <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/11/qualcomm-oryon-custom-cpu-at-center-of-next-gen-premium-experiences-on-snapdragon-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\">2024</a>. In XR, Qualcomm highlighted its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/samsung-google-and-qualcomm-are-making-a-mixed-reality-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnerships</a> with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>). Finally, the company expects its <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/networking/wi-fi-networks/immersive-home-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wi-Fi products</a> to continue benefiting from Wi-Fi mesh growth including WiFi 6 and WiFi 7. Therefore, we believe that the company could continue to face a negative near-term outlook for the IoT segment with the elevated inventory levels, but we expect its long-term growth to be spurred by its product developments and partnerships across CPU, WiFi and XR.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm IoT Estimated Breakdown</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2024F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2025F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2026F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2027F</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Estimated Wi-Fi Revenue</p></td> <td><p>1,483</p></td> <td><p>1,297</p></td> <td><p>1,411</p></td> <td><p>1,597</p></td> <td><p>1,785</p></td> <td><p>1,995</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>-12.6%</p></td> <td><p>8.8%</p></td> <td><p>13.3%</p></td> <td><p>11.8%</p></td> <td><p>11.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Estimated XR Revenue</p></td> <td><p>225</p></td> <td><p>197</p></td> <td><p>246</p></td> <td><p>309</p></td> <td><p>387</p></td> <td><p>485</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>-18.2%</p></td> <td><p>25.3%</p></td> <td><p>25.3%</p></td> <td><p>25.3%</p></td> <td><p>25.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Estimated ARM CPU Revenue</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>487</p></td> <td><p>1,170</p></td> <td><p>2,380</p></td> <td><p>3,798</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>Other IoT</p></td> <td><p>5,241</p></td> <td><p>4,583</p></td> <td><p>5,266</p></td> <td><p>5,945</p></td> <td><p>6,593</p></td> <td><p>7,180</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>-12.6%</p></td> <td><p>14.90%</p></td> <td><p>12.90%</p></td> <td><p>10.90%</p></td> <td><p>8.90%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p><strong>Total IoT</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>6,948</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>6,076</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>7,409</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>9,021</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11,145</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>13,458</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p><strong>Growth %</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>-12.6%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>21.9%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>21.8%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>23.5%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>20.8%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, MarketsandMarkets, Emergen Research, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We updated our revenue projections for Qualcomm's IoT Segment. Firstly, for its Wi-Fi revenue, we adjusted our assumption from our previous analysis for the share of Wi-Fi 7 revenue to increase in 2024 onwards with the <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/05/wi-fi-7-has-arrived-heres-exactly-what-that-means-for-gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction</a> of Qualcomm's Wi-Fi 7. Moreover, we based our forecasts for Qualcomm's XR revenues on the market forecast CAGR of 25.3% by <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/augmented-reality-virtual-reality-market-1185.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MarketsandMarkets</a>. Furthermore, we adjusted our projection for its Arm-based CPU revenue from 2024 onwards instead of our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4491550-qualcomm-arm-cpu-market-presents-3-8-bln-opportunity\">initial projections</a> where we expected it to launch in 2023. Finally, we based its other IoT revenue on the IoT chipset market forecast CAGR by <a href=\"https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/iot-chip-market#:~:text=The%20global%20Internet%20of%20Things,IoT%20chip%20market%20revenue%20growth.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emergen Research</a> but tapered down by 2% per year as a conservative estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, we forecast Qualcomm's IoT segment with a 5-year forward growth of 22%. Additionally, we forecasted its sustainable growth of 20.8% based on our 2027 projection. Although lower than its past 4-year average segment growth of 25.7%, our sustainable growth rate forecast is still significantly higher compared to the overall semicon market growth at a 10-year average of 6.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe its growth for the IoT is sustainable due to the continued advancements in Wi-Fi connectivity technology with the upcoming ramp-up of Wi-Fi 7 to support greater connectivity speeds which we anticipate could benefit Qualcomm's Wi-Fi chipsets revenues. Moreover, we believe its growth in XR is sustainable as highlighted in our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528351-qualcomm-leading-the-pack-in-wi-fi-7\">previous analysis</a> due to various emerging applications across different fields such as healthcare, retail, tourism and defense. Moreover, we believe that its growth in ARM-based CPUs could support sustainable growth for its IoT segment due to the shift towards ARM-based processors as covered previously with Qualcomm expected to benefit as it commercializes its products in 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Risk: Competition from MediaTek</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe one of the key risks for Qualcomm is related to its Handset segment, which is its largest segment contributing 65% of revenues. Qualcomm competes against MediaTek which is the market leader in the overall pureplay smartphone AP. Recently, MediaTek <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/mediatek-beats-qualcomm-samsung-first-3nm-smartphone-processor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its latest premium Dimensity lineup which is based on the most advanced 3nm process technology by TSMC ahead of Qualcomm which we believe indicates MediaTek could be trying to compete more aggressively with Qualcomm in the premium segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Verdict</strong></h2> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qualcomm Revenue Projections ($ bln)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2024F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2025F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2026F</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2027F</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Total IoT</p></td> <td><p>7,351</p></td> <td><p>6,076</p></td> <td><p>7,412</p></td> <td><p>9,023</p></td> <td><p>11,143</p></td> <td><p>13,450</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td><p>35.1%</p></td> <td><p>-17.3%</p></td> <td><p>22.0%</p></td> <td><p>21.7%</p></td> <td><p>23.5%</p></td> <td><p>20.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Handset</p></td> <td><p>28,825</p></td> <td><p>22,819</p></td> <td><p>25,785</p></td> <td><p>28,603</p></td> <td><p>31,240</p></td> <td><p>33,663</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td><p>40.8%</p></td> <td><p>-20.8%</p></td> <td><p>13.0%</p></td> <td><p>10.9%</p></td> <td><p>9.2%</p></td> <td><p>7.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Automotive</p></td> <td><p>1,500</p></td> <td><p>1,783</p></td> <td><p>2,116</p></td> <td><p>2,512</p></td> <td><p>2,981</p></td> <td><p>3,539</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td><p>36.6%</p></td> <td><p>18.8%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> <td><p>18.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>QTL</p></td> <td><p>6,358</p></td> <td><p>6,081</p></td> <td><p>6,355</p></td> <td><p>6,641</p></td> <td><p>6,941</p></td> <td><p>7,253</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-r\"> <td><p>Growth %</p></td> <td><p>0.6%</p></td> <td><p>-4.4%</p></td> <td><p>4.5%</p></td> <td><p>4.5%</p></td> <td><p>4.5%</p></td> <td><p>4.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>QSI</p></td> <td><p>31</p></td> <td><p>31</p></td> <td><p>28.3</p></td> <td><p>26.1</p></td> <td><p>24.1</p></td> <td><p>22.2</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>Growth (%)</p></td> <td><p>-31.1%</p></td> <td><p>-8.4%</p></td> <td><p>-7.8%</p></td> <td><p>-7.8%</p></td> <td><p>-7.8%</p></td> <td><p>-7.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-b\"> <td><p>Reconciling items</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> <td><p>134</p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p><strong>Total Qualcomm</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>44,200</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>36,923</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>41,831</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>46,939</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>52,464</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>58,061</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr class=\"bg-g\"> <td><p><strong>Growth (%)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>31.7%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>-16.5%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>13.3%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>12.2%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11.8%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10.7%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company Data, Khaveen Investments</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, we compiled our revenue projections for the company in the table above. For its QTL and QSI segments, we based it on their 5-year average growth rates. In total, we forecasted the company's revenues to decline by 16.5% in 2023 but recover in 2024 beyond. We forecast its 5-year average of 12% through 2027 excluding 2023. Thus, we believe its growth is sustainable compared to the past 10 years semicon market growth rate of 6.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/14/49636850-16947480718812435_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/14/49636850-16947480718812435.jpg\" alt=\"qualcomm valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Khaveen Investments</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on a discount rate of 10.4% (company's WACC) and terminal value based on the company's 5-year average <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev2ebitda/QCOM/EV-to-EBITDA/Qualcomm#:~:text=As%20of%20today%2C%20Qualcomm's%20enterprise,EBITDA%20for%20today%20is%2010.44.\" rel=\"nofollow\">EV/EBITDA</a> of 11.66x, we obtained an upside of 82% from our DCF model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To conclude, we expect the company's growth trajectory in the Handset segment to be sustainable, largely owing to Qualcomm's dominant position in the premium smartphone market. Although the previous remarkable growth rate of 39% over three years is unlikely to persist due to the deceleration in 5G adoption. Additionally, intensifying competition from MediaTek with the announcement of its next-gen chips could pose a threat to Qualcomm. In the Automotive segment, we anticipate continued sustainable growth, supported by the expanding ADAS market and strengthened by strategic collaborations with global automakers. We also projected the IoT segment's growth to be sustainable, as we anticipate advancements in Wi-Fi connectivity technology, including the upcoming Wi-Fi 7 rollout, to positively impact Qualcomm's chipset revenues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe the momentum in XR to persist due to its diverse applications across various fields such as healthcare, retail, tourism, and defense. Furthermore, we believe that Qualcomm's foray into ARM-based CPUs could also underpin sustained growth in the IoT segment.
