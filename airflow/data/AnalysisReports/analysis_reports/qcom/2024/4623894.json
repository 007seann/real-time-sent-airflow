<p>The company continues to operate in a tough environment as global handset sales remain weak.</p> <p>However, we are likely at or near the trough of the handset cycle<span

devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The near-term opportunity would still be a recovery in the handset market, which will certainly see valuation multiples expand and return to the company's longer-term average P/E multiple.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Review of Fiscal Q3 2023 results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revenue and EBT

invisible\">Guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3995438-qualcomm-stumbles-weak-q4-guidance\">FY4Q23 guidance</a> came in weaker than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revenue guidance was between the range of <a href=\"https://investor.qualcomm.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000804328-23-000043/0000804328-23-000043.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$8.1 billion to $8.9 billion</a> compared to consensus of $8.8 billion. This includes QCT revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.5 billion, and QTL revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">EPS was guided in the range of $1.80 to 2.00, compared to the consensus of $1.95. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Market outlook and commentary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4623041-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">Qualcomm stated</a> that they reiterate their expectation that handset units in 2023 will be down at least a high single-digit percentage when compared to that of 2022. This is a result of a slower recovery in China and a difficult macro environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, channel inventory within IoT remains elevated. This also is a result of the weaker demand as a result of the current macroeconomic environment. Qualcomm's guidance implies conservative results, as they are operating under the assumption that this weakness in the IoT segment will continue for the rest of fiscal 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Looking forward to the fiscal year 2024, Qualcomm hints that the growth in revenue will largely be dependent on the recovery in China, the macroeconomic environment, and the recovery in global handset sales. There are some drivers for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 in the form of a stronger seasonality effect from the QTL segment and the handset launch from a modem-only customer. IoT and automotive revenues are expected to see a sequential decline in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, in-line with the seasonal patterns observed in the past few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the costs side of things, Qualcomm continues to focus on operational discipline and looks to implement more cost initiatives in the first half of fiscal year 2024 to ensure that its long-term operating profit margins targets will be achieved. The cost focus comes as Qualcomm looks to control its cost structure as the macroeconomic environment remains weak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm will continue to invest in strategic priorities in its business to ensure that when the down cycle ends, the company is able to take full advantage of the recovery in the market when it occurs. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Weakness continues until end CY23, recovery pushed back to CY24</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For Qualcomm, while I think the company is well positioned when the smartphone market reaches trough levels and when the market poses a recovery, but the magnitude of that recovery was somewhat derailed in the near-term due to two reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">First, Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), one of Qualcomm's largest customers as highlighted before, expects to digest inventory in the near-term and thus, pushes back the seasonal strength we typically see from Apple in the September quarter. Thus, as a result of the digestion of inventory for legacy models, this seasonal strength is expected to then only come in the December quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In my view, this is actually to be expected, as I have mentioned before that Apple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1422-outperforming-the-market/articles/5874112-stock-idea-10-qualcomm-stock-is-too-cheap-to-ignore-after-q2-earnings\">overbought</a> Qualcomm's products in 2022, and thus, Qualcomm over-earned from Apple in 2022. This does highlight to me that this weakness comes more from a timing issue rather than anything fundamental, as Qualcomm expects to be taking up most of the market share in the new upcoming Apple launches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Second, Qualcomm had a 4G license with Huawei, but it does not have a 5G license agreement with Huawei. As a result, Qualcomm will not have its modem in the new Mate launching in 2024. This represents almost $1 billion in headwinds to QCT revenue that came from Mate units. Huawei is transitioning to use their own in-house modems for their 5G smartphones in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As highlighted above, Qualcomm sees a challenging market in both handsets and IoT, with continued inventory digestion in the near term for the rest of the calendar year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This implies that the expectations for stronger cyclical growth in the sector will likely be pushed out to CY2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The expectation is thus that the current FY3Q23 quarter is somewhat of a trough quarter, with revenues in FY4Q23 likely coming in flat compared to the prior quarter, and I expect that we will see an uptick in FY1Q24 and a broader smartphone recovery in CY2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There have been multiple <a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/global-smartphone-market-showing-signs-090624063.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">data points</a> from other smartphone suppliers that are suggesting that the smartphone markets and consumer end markets are starting to show evidence of recovery trends.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">AI upside</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm has a significant opportunity to leverage the strong growth in generative AI at the edg,e as there are many different use cases of generative AI at the edge rather than in the cloud as a result of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4623041-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">differences</a> in the \"inherent context, immediacy, privacy, security, application reliability and personalization capabilities available on device.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In handsets, stable diffusion and control net can change user experiences in photography and content creation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In PCs, the enablement of copilots should bring improvements to creativity and productivity across different industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the quarter, Qualcomm announced a <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/07/qualcomm-works-with-meta-to-enable-on-device-ai-applications-usi\" rel=\"nofollow\">collaboration</a> with Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) that will enable developers to make new generative AI applications using the AI capabilities of the Snapdragon platforms starting 2024. Qualcomm is also working with Meta to help optimize the execution of Meta's Llama 2 large language models directly on device.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, Qualcomm is also<a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/05/qualcomm-and-microsoft-align-efforts-to-scale-on-device-ai-at-bu\" rel=\"nofollow\"> working</a> with Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) to scale AI capabilities and bring the AI experience to users on consumer, enterprise and industrial devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">They also announced a focused collaboration with Microsoft to scale AI capabilities and bring best-in-class AI experience to users across consumer, enterprise and industrial devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think that Qualcomm is uniquely positioned to leverage on the on-device generative AI opportunity. Qualcomm is known for its best-in-class high-performance and low-power computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The upside from the AI opportunity will come from an increased size of the market as a result of Qualcomm enabling AI-capable smartphones, as well as increases in the content and selling prices of Qualcomm's products that will drive growth going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm is trading at just 12x 2024 P/E.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To put this into perspective, since I am expecting that we are at the trough of the handset cycle, with a likely broad-based recovery in CY2024 in the smartphone market, this presents an attractive risk-reward opportunity, as the downside has mostly been priced in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With its 10-year average of 20x P/E, Qualcomm is trading at a 40% discount to its long-term average P/E, as a consequence of where we are right now in the handset market cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, I expect that Qualcomm is the main beneficiary from the increasing adoption of AI capabilities on edge devices in the long-term as this will drive additional content upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am reiterating my 1-year price target of $155, which is based on a 17x 2024 P/E multiple assumption. This is still at a slight discount to its long-term average P/E, but given the near-term headwinds, this conservatism is justified in my view. This represents 31% upside potential from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am also reiterating my intrinsic value and 3-year price targets for Qualcomm, which can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1422-outperforming-the-market/articles/5874112-stock-idea-10-qualcomm-stock-is-too-cheap-to-ignore-after-q2-earnings\">here</a>. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the guidance provided by the management was somewhat lackluster, the overall broader industry remains weak given the macroeconomic environment and weakness in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, we are likely at or near the trough of the handset cycle, as management expects next quarter revenue to be somewhat flat relative to the current quarter revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, I think that management articulated the AI opportunity that it has on devices and the edge well as Qualcomm is uniquely positioned to enable AI-powered devices across markets.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At just 12x 2024 P/E, Qualcomm remains a contrarian position in the portfolio, with near-term upside from the handset recovery in 2024 and longer-term upside from AI, automotive and IoT.</p>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm: Time To Buy As The Handset Cycle Is Near Market Trough. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4623894-qualcomm-time-to-buy-as-handset-cycle-near-market-trough?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<h2>Outperforming the Market</h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1422\">Outperforming the Market</a>\u00a0</strong>is focused on helping you outperform the market while having downside protection during volatile markets by providing you with comprehensive deep dive analysis articles, as well as access to <strong>The Barbell Portfolio</strong>.</p><p>The Barbell Portfolio has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by <strong>97%</strong> in the past year through owning high conviction growth, value and contrarian stocks.</p><p>Apart from focusing on bottom-up fundamental research, we also provide you with intrinsic value, 1-year and 3-year price targets in <strong>The Price Target report</strong>.\u00a0</p><p>Join us for the\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1422\">2-week free trial</a></strong> to get access to The Barbell Portfolio today! <br></p>", "marketingBullet": "This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, Outperforming the Market. <a href='/checkout?service_id=mp_1422&source=mp_marketing_text_top' sasource='mp_marketing_text_top'>Learn More \u00bb</a>", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I am Simple Investing, a former manager of a hedge fund with over $1B in AUM and a strong track record.
