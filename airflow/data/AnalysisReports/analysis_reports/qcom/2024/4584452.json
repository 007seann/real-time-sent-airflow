Investors will also be paying close attention to Treasury yields, especially the 10-year Treasury note after its flirtation with the 4% level. On the political front, the White House is expected to release a proposed budget on March 9. The proposal could have implications for some defense stocks depending on the funding levels that are eventually worked out with Congress. Meanwhile, earnings reports slow down quite a bit in the week ahead, although updates from DICK'S Sporting Goods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKS\" title=\"DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.\">DKS</a>) and Oracle (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a></span>) could rattle their respective sectors. Seeking Alpha contributor Geoffrey Seiler has his eyes on the earnings reports, including Allbirds (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIRD\" title=\"Allbirds, Inc.\">BIRD</a>), and in his view the retailer needs a change in management. Meanwhile, Mike Zaccardi thinks Buckle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKE\" title=\"The Buckle, Inc.\">BKE</a>) is undervalued even if the upcoming earnings report shows some weakness. The calendar next week also includes a large number of corporate events with the potential to move share prices. Apple's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) annual meeting, a General Electric (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE\" title=\"General Electric Company\">GE</a>) event, and Mattel's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) Investor Day are some of the headliners.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Earnings spotlight: Monday, March 6</strong> - Trip.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCOM\" title=\"Trip.com Group Limited\">TCOM</a>), Guidewire Software (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GWRE\" title=\"Guidewire Software, Inc.\">GWRE</a></span>), and Lordstown Motors (RIDE).</p> <p><strong>Earnings spotlight: Tuesday, March 7</strong> - DICK'S Sporting Goods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKS\" title=\"DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.\">DKS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">), CrowdStrike (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CRWD</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">), Sea Limited (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content invisible\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SE\" title=\"Sea Limited\">SE</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Earnings spotlight: Wednesday, March 8</strong> -United Natural Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNFI\" title=\"United Natural Foods, Inc.\">UNFI</a>), Campbell Soup (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPB\" title=\"The Campbell's Company\">CPB</a></span>), and MongoDB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB\" title=\"MongoDB, Inc.\">MDB</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Earnings spotlight: Thursday, March 9</strong> - JD.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JD\" title=\"JD.com, Inc.\">JD</a>), Gap (GPS), Ulta Beauty (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULTA\" title=\"Ulta Beauty, Inc.\">ULTA</a>), DocuSign (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" title=\"DocuSign, Inc.\">DOCU</a>), and Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Earnings spotlight: Friday, March 10</strong> - Buckle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKE\" title=\"The Buckle, Inc.\">BKE</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Volatility watch:</strong> Silvergate Capital (SI) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) are once again at the top of the list of stocks with the highest percentage of short interest outstanding. Options trading has spiked over the last week on Genius Group Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNS\" title=\"Genius Group Limited\">GNS</a>). In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETH-USD\" title=\"Ethereum USD\">ETH-USD</a>) could see some swings as tests are run ahead of the Shanghai hard fork. Following the major network upgrade, 16M staked ether will become withdrawable by validators that help operate and secure the network.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>IPO watch:</strong> Health and wellness provider Nava Health (NAVA) and fracking material provider Atlas Energy Solutions (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AESI\" title=\"Atlas Energy Solutions Inc.\">AESI</a></span>) are expected to start trading next week.

Of the group, Nextracker has seen the biggest post-IPO rally. Another major private company appears to be pushing off an IPO, with Impossible Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMPF\" title=\"Impossible Foods\">IMPF</a>) saying a 2024 public launch is more likely than a trading debut this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividend watch:</strong> Companies forecast to boost their quarterly dividend payouts include Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) to $0.38 from $0.32, DICK'S Sporting Goods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKS\" title=\"DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.\">DKS</a>) to $0.5375 from $0.4875, Qualcomm (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a></span>) to $0.81 from $0.75, General Dynamics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GD\" title=\"General Dynamics Corporation\">GD</a>) to $1.36 from $1.26, and American Tower (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMT\" title=\"American Tower Corporation\">AMT</a></span>) to $1.58 from $1.56.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Jobs report preview:</strong> The February jobs report could have huge significance following the January blowout number of 517K job additions. The consensus estimate is for 215K new jobs to have been added to the economy, but a lower number could shift the narrative on if the January print was a one-off. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4% and a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings is anticipated. Average weekly hours are expected to dip to 34.6 from 34.7. Bank of America thinks a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of NFP prints. \"Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month\" noted the firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Corporate events:</strong> Oatly (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OTLY\" title=\"Oatly Group AB\">OTLY</a></span>) will hold an extraordinary general meeting on March 7 to vote on a proposal to increase the limits in the number of shares to increase the room for issuance of additional shares without the need for further shareholder approval. Shares of Oatly fell sharply when the capital raise plan was first announced. Dover (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>), Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), and Coherent (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COHR\" title=\"Coherent Corp.\">COHR</a></span>) all have investor events scheduled for March 8 with the potential to jolt shares. In the tech sector, Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) will hold its annual meeting on March 9. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has urged AAPL investors to vote for the company's director nominees and the pay packages for top executives, including Chief Executive Tim Cook. The proxy advisory firm also recommended investors vote for proposals including a resolution demanding a report on median gender and racial pay gaps, and an amendment of proxy access right, both of which were opposed by AAPL management.

Powerful new software is helping hold down pesticide, fertilizer, and seed costs, while raising crop output. In the future, artificial intelligence and software could help planters, sprayers, and combine harvesters run themselves more efficiently. The Department of Agriculture forecasts net cash farm income will be $150.6B last year, which adjusted for inflation is well above the 20-year average of $130.5B. The publication thinks the recent trends do not signal a peak of a cycle, but are indicative of the most rapid change in food production since the rise of mechanized farming. Deere (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DE\" title=\"Deere &amp; Company\">DE</a>), AGCO (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGCO\" title=\"AGCO Corporation\">AGCO</a>), Titan Machinery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TITN\" title=\"Titan Machinery Inc.\">TITN</a>), Corteva (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTVA\" title=\"Corteva, Inc.\">CTVA</a>), Farmland Partners (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FPI\" title=\"Farmland Partners Inc.\">FPI</a>), and CNH Industrial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNH\" title=\"CNH Industrial N.V.\">CNH</a>) are some of the stocks seen reaping benefits if there is a long-lasting farming boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong><em> <em>EDGAR, Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters</em> </em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.
