The worldwide semiconductor revenue history below shows the 1996 - 2023 period. So, we can see that the demand peak happened between 2021 and 2022. Now the sales are down somewhat. How long this decline would last is uncertain.

As I wrote before, China, Qualcomm's major country of operation, is experiencing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629990-energy-sector-monetary-easing-will-lift-oil-prices\">an economic downturn</a>. Europe's economy is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4408\" rel=\"nofollow\">not growing fast</a> either. It is unclear how long this economic downturn would last. However, the more the economy is down, the bigger the chances are the central banks all around the world would ease their monetary policies, which will obviously be beneficial for the industrial sector and Qualcomm as well. But at the moment there are plenty of uncertainties and the management does not expect dramatic growth in the near future, given the earnings outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Comparison to peers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At the same time, if we take the semiconductor sector, QCOM seems to be better positioned than its peers. In this respect, Qualcomm is more undervalued than its competitors, whilst it is also relatively large and profitable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/12/50290581-1694554789416311_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1342\" data-height=\"308\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/12/50290581-1694554789416311.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm's peers\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The tables below suggest that Qualcomm's sales, EBIT, 3-year average net income, and EPS are much better than its close peers', namely Intel's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and AMD's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-1694624507975675_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-1694624507975675.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm's fundamental indicators\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-1694625172782711_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1302\" data-height=\"416\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-1694625172782711.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm's fundamental indicators\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quite <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633938-qualcomm-downgrading-to-sell-higher-risk-profile-into-2024\">an interesting table</a> was presented by my fellow Seeking Alpha analyst Tech Stock Pros. My fellow contributor is not particularly bullish on Qualcomm either. But it seems that QCOM is relatively profitable and has high sales, even compared to Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), a mega-popular company among investors. The only significant disadvantage of Qualcomm compared to its rivals is its lack of earnings progress or better said declining EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-16946253730352201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"698\" data-height=\"345\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/13/50290581-16946253730352201.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm's fundamentals\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuations</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation Grade and Underlying Metrics - QCOM Valuation Grade</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It seems to me that QCOM is one of the most undervalued stocks in the semiconductor industry. This is especially true of its profitability ratios, including P/E, EV/EBIT, and EV/EBITDA. The company's price-to-free cash flow ratio and dividend yield are also very good. However, the only indicator where it does not excel in terms of valuation is QCOM's P/B ratio. Qualcomm's P/S ratio is quite mediocre. But it suggests the company has high efficiency indicators, namely net profit and gross profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/12/50290581-16945546514115098_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"777\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/12/50290581-16945546514115098.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm valuations\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, I would say the company is quite undervalued compared to its peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Upside risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The first risk is that the semiconductor industry will start growing after the temporary decline. So, Qualcomm's struggling sales and net profits will finally improve. The second upside risk is closely linked to the first one. Central banks, most importantly the Fed, will start easing soon, thus preventing a full-scale recession. This will obviously be a plus for the semiconductors industry. Then, the US-China relations may improve. This is significant since most of QCOM's sales are due to China. We all know that further tariffs and other regulatory actions, the result of deteriorating US-China relations, may, therefore, become a problem for Qualcomm. If some of them get canceled, it will be an upside factor for the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Downside risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The downside risks are more substantial, in my view. The first one is that of a longer economic downturn. Qualcomm's business depends entirely on the health of the global economy because most semiconductors and microchips are used in consumer products and factory equipment. So, the demand for these will stay low if the global economy does not do well. Then, as I have mentioned before, the US-China relations are quite poor. Plus, there is high competition among companies producing semiconductors. As I have explained in the previous section, some of the Qualcomm's competitors are enjoying high sales and EPS growth. At the same time, these rivals are far too overvalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm, one of the largest semiconductor businesses, is not going through its best days. The outlook issued by the management suggests no great improvements in the next couple of quarters. However, it is well possible the stock is quite undervalued right now, especially compared to its competitors. In the case of the economy's soft landing, the company's sales and EPS may improve.
