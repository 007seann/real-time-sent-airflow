When I wrote last year's<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> article, Seeking Alpha showed Qualcomm's dividend growth streak as 2 years (first image below). Although it wasn't wrong per se, it was looking at the fact that Qualcomm did not increase dividends for 8 straight quarters between 2018 and 2020. I argued in my 2022 article linked above that on an annual basis, the dividend growth streak was in fact at 19 years. I am glad to see that Seeking Alpha now has the streak as 19 years as shown in the second image below.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16782855921833224.png\" alt=\"Qcom Dividend Streak\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span style=\"background-color: navy; color: white;\"></span>QCOM Dividend Streak (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16782856047055216_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"899\" data-height=\"186\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16782856047055216.png\" alt=\"Qcom Dividend Streak\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span style=\"background-color: navy; color: white;\"></span>QCOM Dividend Streak (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That makes the latest announcements Qualcomm's 20th consecutive dividend streak. That is a significant number. Two full decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For ease of comparison, this article uses the same format as last year's review with an additional section added on Free Cash Flow (\"FCF\"). Let us get into the details.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>New Yield Of Qualcomm</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The new annual dividend of <strong>$3.20</strong> per share gives QUALCOMM a current yield of <strong>2.64%, </strong>which is higher than the 2% at the time of last year's review. This is primarily due to the almost 19% fall in Qualcomm's share price with the recent dividend increase playing a small role as well. Qualcomm is a cyclical company and the share price will fluctuate based on demand's ebbs and flows. From a dividend coverage and dividend growth perspective, what is more important to see are the sections below.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <strong>Qualcomm's</strong><strong> Five-Year Dividend Growth Rate</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The 5 year dividend growth rate is about 5.50% now after the latest dividend increase. This continues the recent trend where Qualcomm's dividend growth rate has slowed down significantly from the double digit increases it was dishing out till 2016. However, given the room in the payout ratio as explained in the two sections below, Qualcomm can well afford a steady 5% increase on average going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <strong>Qualcomm's </strong><strong>Payout Ratio based on EPS</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm's payout ratio based on forward EPS of $9.37 stands at a very comfortable <strong>34%</strong>. It was <strong>31%</strong> last year. And for the records, it was <strong>70%</strong> when I reviewed the same in 2016 and <strong>43%</strong> in 2014. Again, what does this say about the company and stock? Cyclical.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong> </strong></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Free Cash Flow Strength</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's evaluate Qualcomm's dividend coverage strength using Free Cash Flow, shares outstanding and the new dividend.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Total <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/shares_outstandinghttps://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/shares_outstanding\" rel=\"nofollow\">shares outstanding</a>: 1.115 Billion</li> <li>New quarterly dividend per share: 80 cents</li> <li>Quarterly FCF needed to cover the new dividend: $892 Million</li> <li> <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/QCOM/free_cash_flow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Average quarterly FCF</a> over the last 5 years: $1.529 Billion</li> <li>Payout ratio using average 5 year quarterly FCF: <strong>58%</strong> ($892 Million divided by $1.529 Billion)</li> <li>As another confirmation of Qualcomm's cyclical nature, quarterly FCF has ranged from -$582 Million to $4.661 Billion over the last five years. It is not surprising to note that Qualcomm's FCF was at its lowest point in recent times between 2018 and 2019, exactly when it did not increase the dividend.</li> <li>I see three things here:<ul> <li>Even through the tough times in 2018 and 2019, Qualcomm did not cut its dividend.</li> <li>The dividend increases resumed their usual pattern (first quarter) in 2020 when the company likely knew the cycle was turning.</li> <li>The company acted responsibly by not increasing dividend when it couldn't afford one.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Extrapolation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The last two increases have been about 8% each but there may also be years where Qualcomm is pressured to even afford an increase. The table below shows the expected yield on cost for an investor willing to stick with Qualcomm for the next ten years. The assumed dividend growth rate is 5% per year, same as in the previous article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figcaption><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16783224556416128_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1117\" data-height=\"313\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16783224556416128.png\" alt=\"QCom Extrapolation\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span style=\"background-color: navy; color: white;\"></span>QCOM Extrapolation (Author)</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Forward Thoughts</strong></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The safest dividend is one that has just been raised. The increased dividend also highlights the company's confidence in its immediate prospects.</li> <li>Qualcomm's earnings are <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM/analysis?p=QCOM\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to retreat at <strong>7%</strong> per year for the next five years, primarily due to the weakness in mobile handset market. This does not concern me immediately as I've been with Qualcomm many years and the company's dividend commitment seems strong. Twenty years of increasing dividends does add a whole lot of credibility to this point.</li> <li>The weakness in mobile handset market is not to be brushed off as it still forms 2/3rd of the company's revenue. However, Qualcomm's efforts to diversify its revenue streams is softening the blow due to mobile handset weakness as covered in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577887-qualcomm-focus-on-the-diversity-strategy-while-enjoying-strong-free-cash-flow\">this</a> Seeking Alpha article. For example, Automotive revenue increased 58% YoY while staring at a <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2022/09/qualcomm-s-automotive-design-win-pipeline-expands-to--30-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Total Addressable Market</a> (\"TAM\") of $100 Billion by 2030.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16783239838626394_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"678\" data-height=\"464\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16783239838626394.png\" alt=\"QCOM Revenue by Segment\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span style=\"background-color: navy; color: white;\"></span>QCOM Revenue by Segment (Qualcomm)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>While announcing the dividend increase, Qualcomm's CEO made a reference to the company executing \"anti-dilutive stock repurchases\". This shows two things: a) they are rewarding shareholders with dividend increases and stock buybacks (b) Qualcomm, like other technology companies, attracts talent using Restricted Stock Units (\"RSU\"), which dilutes shareholders. The fact that he highlighted \"anti-dilutive\" shows extreme awareness of shareholder concerns.</li> <li>Finally, the general market weakness and fundamental concerns including continuing demand weakness and the prospects of Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) using its own modems for iPhones have beaten down the stock to a technically oversold level as shown below. Buying beaten down stocks of great companies has generally served investors well in the long run.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/8/1003408-16783235832662613.png\" alt=\"Qcom RSI\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span style=\"background-color: navy; color: white;\"></span>QCOM RSI (Stock RSI)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm's fall from about $190 in January 2022 to about $120 right now has undoubtedly been painful for shareholders. But the market has been through a lot due to COVID, economic excesses, inflation, and resulting Fed policies. Those factors are almost never in an individual company's control. Add to those factors the basic nature of Qualcomm as a business: cyclical ups and downs. The fact that Qualcomm has increased dividends for 20 consecutive years (on an annual basis) despite all those factors stated above shows they know what they are doing as a business and their commitment to shareholders.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am happy to stick with Qualcomm here and rate the stock a buy as it is trading at a forward multiple of just 12. The stock is undervalued compared to peers including high-flying darlings like NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and ones that seem to be on the death-bed like Intel Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>).</p> <div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display: none;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\"> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\"> </div> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\"> </div> <div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\"> </div> </div></div>", "twitContent": "$QCOM - Qualcomm's 2023 Dividend Increase. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585809-qualcomm-stock-2023-dividend-increase-undervalued?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "25319", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "442702", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1168", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "35889", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4585809-qualcomm-stock-2023-dividend-increase-undervalued", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585809-qualcomm-stock-2023-dividend-increase-undervalued", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1390379868/image_1390379868.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "25319", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "tradevestor", "userId": 1003408, "tagId": 35889, "bio": "<p>Dividends (DGI and DRIP) and Growth at reasonable price (GARP) for Long-term.
