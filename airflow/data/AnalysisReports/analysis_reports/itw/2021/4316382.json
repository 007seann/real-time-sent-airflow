It has over the years acquired company after company, making it a powerhouse within its various operating segments. With operations in automotive equipment, test and measurement and electronics, food equipment, polymers and fluids, welding, the construction industry, and specialty categories, the company is economically sensitive in more ways than one. The company has, however, been a steady compounding growth machine and continues to work toward a brighter future. The company has been experiencing weakness for a few quarters, which should lead the shares closer to low, not highs. At the very least, shares should not be trading at a premium valuation until the fundamental story has changed.</p> <h2>Performance</h2> <p>ITW recently reported first quarter earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed slightly on revenue estimated.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786756245878181.png\" data-width=\"463\" data-height=\"150\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3454155-illinois-tool-works-misses-0_01-misses-on-revenue\">Seeking Alpha</a></p> <p>This marked the 4th quarter in a row with revenue declines. The third quarter of 2019 was the first time since the first quarter of 2016 that the company reported an actual decline in revenue. The company did see earnings grow to $2.04 from $1.90 per share which includes a $0.05 headwind from currency headwinds. Operating margins expanded alongside free cash flow which of course are all positives.</p> <p>Earlier in the year the company was able to affirm guidance that was higher than now as it it believed the second half of the year would be much stronger. It saw improving business sentiment after January which led it to believe it will continue to see its expectations for growth met. The company however now expects EPS of $7.55 to $7.85, which represents -1%-2% growth over year. This is quite unimpressive and should not be leading the shares to new highs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/140/44140/slides/10.jpg?1564156384\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"989\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4278095-illinois-tool-works-inc-2019-q2-results-earnings-call-slides\">Earnings Presentation</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As we can see the company continues to expect weak results. What will lead to a turn around has yet to be seen. Perhaps the longstanding tradition of being such a conglomerate could soon she calls for a breakup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Below we can see a better picture of the first quarter performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static3.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/140/44140/slides/3.jpg?1564156384\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"989\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"> Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4278095-illinois-tool-works-inc-2019-q2-results-earnings-call-slides\">Earnings Presentation</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a positive note the company was able to produce strong free cash flow growth of 12%. This is attractive and helps the company continue to reward shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. In the quarter the company repurchased $375 million worth of shares as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company saw the weakest results in its automotive division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/140/44140/slides/5.jpg?1564156384\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"989\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Earnings Presentation</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is where they highlight they believe stable or growing demand in the back half will improve operating performance. However, as we can see, almost every division experienced a decline in organic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company continued repurchasing shares in the quarter as well with almost 13 million shares outstanding reduced from the year prior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786768214345653.png\" data-width=\"471\" data-height=\"337\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4674169\">10Q</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is about 4% of shares outstanding taken out of the market. A rather large amount for given year. The company has reduced shares outstanding from 500 million shares in 2010 to the current 323 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/saupload_c2c02d36acdc6d3cb23897f319e1ccf1.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With more than 33% of shares outstanding repurchased in the last 9 years, investors would be larger shareholders of the company. It also has been a well-allocated plan; as we can see above the share price has increase three fold since it started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lastly, taking a look at the balance sheet, we see the company is financially sound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786769180809574.png\" data-width=\"465\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Source: 10Q</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Though debt is a bit high versus cash on hand, the company generates plenty of free cash flow each quarter to cover its obligations. With $1.825 billion in cash on hand versus $7.6 billion in debt, the company is well-positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders and acquire companies when an opportunity arises. Debt has risen slightly from the end of 2018, about $300 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has outlined its debt/EBITDA ratio by using the below calculation, making it easy for investors to keep an eye on financial soundness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786770260070097.png\" data-width=\"477\" data-height=\"180\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Source: 10Q</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The rise in the Debt/EBITDA was due to both the decline in net income and rise in long term debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the company expects to perform better in the coming quarters, there is little room for error at the current share price. The company is a prudent manager of capital and produces strong free cash flow but is reliant upon strong industrial demand. Should the current trade dispute remain unsolved, the company may have to end up revising guidance downward. With that we must see if the shares are a good value at this time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works shares have rallied off the lows to new highs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/saupload_560716218625ebae3c3e58ceb80f1057.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW shares trade at the highest forward P/E, offer the lowest yield, and have the highest forward PEG ratio. This would all be understandable if the company was significantly outperforming peers, but as have seen that is not the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking at valuation historically for the company we see the following results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786773762102377_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"793\" data-height=\"461\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786773762102377.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"372\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> Source: <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/itw/quote.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morningstar</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The shares currently offer a higher forward P/E and P/E in than in the past 5 years. They also offer a higher P/B, PEG ratio, and P/S ratio than they have for the last 5 years. This all points to sign of overvaluation and would only be acceptable if the company was expecting above average growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Next, we look at the company's historical yield to see if shares are offering a higher than normal yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786775679788444_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"743\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/47087046-15786775679788444.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"562\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.yieldchart.com/?symbol=itw\" rel=\"nofollow\">YieldChart</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sure enough, the company is currently yielding 2.38%. With a new quarterly payout of $1.07 per share, the company, which has raised its dividend for 44 years, now offers an above average yield versus its own history. The high spike in the middle of the chart was during the 2008 recession and the company was then yielding over 4%. A situation being unlikely to unfold like that again leaves the 2.38% looking quite nice. In fact only about 35% of the time in the past 24 years of trading has the company offered a yield in this range. The average yield is around 1.8% so investors would do well purchasing shares at a time when it is 40% higher than normal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works shares have rallied to a level that offers little upside. With the recent performance coming in below expectations, I would need to see a turnaround to believe in the rally. With the company steadily reducing shares outstanding, being a dividend aristocrat, and performing reliably, investors can be assured that their investment will do well over time when acquired at the right price. Investors should keep an eye on areas of weakness that may cause further pressure on results. Such categories as automotive are cyclical and could cause a downturn in earnings, but as any cycle goes, it usually returns to normal at some point. A trade deal in the coming quarters would be a positive as well as the price increases implemented to deal with tariffs would remain and further increase margins. But in the meantime the company continues to face margin pressures and currency headwinds that will put pressure on earnings. When many other competitors are facing the same weakness and trading at lower valuations, it is a testament of the strength in the ITW shareholder base. This sentiment can turn at any time, though. The shares need to fall back or fundamentals need to improve for me to become a buyer.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works: The Fundamentals Don't Match The Valuation. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4316382-illinois-tool-works-fundamentals-dont-match-valuation?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "104579", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "253788", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2752", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "583546", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17917", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4316382-illinois-tool-works-fundamentals-dont-match-valuation", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4316382-illinois-tool-works-fundamentals-dont-match-valuation", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/saupload_illinois-tool-works-logo-vector.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/1/10/saupload_illinois-tool-works-logo-vector.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "104579", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "allstartrader", "userId": 47087046, "tagId": 583546, "bio": "<p>Started investing at 11 years old.
