Since its founding more than 100 years ago, the firm has grown to be an international powerhouse in the supply of specialized industrial equipment, consumables, and related services. In recent years, the company has continued growing, though at a slow pace. Add in the fallout associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2020 has proven to be a negative year for the business. Even so, shares of the business have been doing well as of late and indicate that investors are generally bullish on the company and its prospects. In the long run, Illinois Tool Works is likely to fare well fundamentally, but taking all things into consideration shares do look quite pricey. For investors looking for attractive opportunities in this space, there are likely better prospects on the market to be had.</p> <h2>Robust performance over time</h2> <p>Illinois Tool Works is a large and <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/49826/000004982620000020/itw-20191231x10k.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-diversified</a> firm. By large, I mean its market cap as of this writing is a robust $64.1 billion. By well-diversified, I mean that the company's operations are split between seven different operating segments. These segments are as follows: Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics, Welding, Polymers &amp; Fluids, Construction Products, and Specialty Products. This gives the business exposure to countless aspects of the industrial space. The firm is also diversified geographically as well. About 46.1% of sales come from the US, with another 6.9% coming from Canada and Mexico combined. This brings its North American operations up to 53% of the company's overall revenue. However, a further 27.8% comes from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 17% comes from the Asia Pacific region, and the remaining 2.2% comes from South America.</p> <p>This range of product lines and diversification across geographic<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> regions make the company, in a sense, a proxy for the world's broader economic industrial growth. This robust chain of operations has, in turn, proven positive for the company over time. Back in 2015, for instance, Illinois Tool Works generated sales of $13.41 billion. By 2018, sales had expanded to $14.77 billion. This declined modestly to $14.11 billion in 2019. Operating income has been more volatile, though from 2017 through 2019 it has ranged within a narrow $200 million boundary between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion. Operating cash flow, however, has done exceptionally well, rising each year from at least 2015 when the company generated $2.30 billion in cash flow, to 2019 when it generated about $3 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So far, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/49826/000004982620000106/itw-20200930.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2020</a> has proven to be a rough patch for the business. This should come as not surprising given the results of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales in the first three quarters of this year have totaled $9.10 billion. This is down from $10.64 billion the same period last year. It is worth noting, though, that in some ways the company's diverse operations are working in its favor. For instance, while in the second quarter this year its Asia Pacific business saw organic revenue decline by 7%, in the third quarter it actually expanded by 3%. In China specifically, sales were up 10% compared to 1% one quarter earlier. Some of its segments have also improved. Polymers and Plastics, for instance, saw sales grow 6% compared to a 14% hit seen previously, while its Construction Products segment went from a decline of 9% to an expansion of 8%. All other segments saw continued contraction, though the numbers were far better than the second quarter's figures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With 2020 nearly over, management does believe they have sufficient knowledge to estimate what the year will look like. If their forecasts are correct, overall organic revenue will have declined by between 11% and 11.5%. Operating income, meanwhile, should be between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion with a midpoint of $2.75 billion. This is down from $3.40 billion a year earlier. If the relationship between operating income and operating cash flow holds, this implies operating cash flow for 2020 of around $2.42 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Irrespective of how 2020 ends up looking, investors should consider this year to be a bump in the road to the firm's long-term success. This assumes, of course, that management's current guidance for the next few years is accurate. They believe that by 2023 the business will see its organic revenue growing between 3% and 5% per annum, with earnings per share growing by 7% to 10% annually. Since free cash flow is expected to more or less match earnings, this implies a similar increase in per-share operating cash flow each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Putting a value on any firm can be tricky, but the stability of its cash flows can help make this job easier. There's no doubt that Illinois Tool Works is a valuable company, but at present it looks like shares are pricey. Consider, for instance, if we use estimated operating cash flow for 2020. With the company's $64.1 billion market cap, this implies a price/operating cash flow multiple of around 26.5. Even if we use 2019's operating cash flow of nearly $3 billion, the multiple is still a lofty 21.4. This is not to say that shares are never inexpensive. Back when units had fallen to a 52-week low point earlier this year, the firm's 2020 price/operating cash flow multiple would have been 15.2, while its 2019 figure would have been 12.3. This isn't deep value territory, but it is attractive for a high-quality firm like Illinois Tool Works.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based on the data provided, it seems clear that Illinois Tool Works is an interesting business with attractive long-term prospects from a fundamental perspective. Its diverse business and operating history make it a great play on global industry, but it has hit a bit of a rough patch lately. This, too, shall pass, but one thing investors need to ask themselves is how much the company is actually worth. At present, even if we assume things will go back to normal, shares look pricey and investors probably would be better off looking elsewhere for upside potential.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works: A Quality Company But At A High Price. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396643-illinois-tool-works-quality-company-high-price?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?slug=daniel-jones&service_id=mp_1209\">Crude Value Insights</a> offers you an investing service and community focused on oil and natural gas.
