(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW\" title=\"Illinois Tool Works Inc.\">ITW</a></span>) is a $45 billion market cap global supplier of industrial tooling, it is somewhat of a cyclical industrial stock, with a 24 month Beta of 1.11. Due to this, ITW is exposed to the global macroeconomic environment and in this article I discuss a range of valuation scenarios depending on what will happen to the global economy during the next five years.</p> <h2><strong>Going in with weakness</strong></h2> <p>ITW's top-line growth during FY17 and FY18 was 5.3% and 3.2% which was decent compared to nominal GDP growth in the OECD (<a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/gdp/nominal-gdp-forecast.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">4.8% both years</a>). However during FY19 revenue decreased -4.5%, a staggering 8.4% underperformance compared to nominal global GDP growth of 3.9%.</p> <p>Management explained this being due to weakness especially in the Automotive segment, as can be seen from their Q4 2019 earnings presentation below. Market growth was -6% in the Automotive sector also Welding was down -3% during 2019. On the positive side Food equipment held up at +/- 0%.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/1/966112-15857614452893913_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"832\" data-height=\"510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/1/966112-15857614452893913.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"392\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/Cache/IRCache/7ef41b87-5e68-24c0-7c69-635889ab8e60.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=7ef41b87-5e68-24c0-7c69-635889ab8e60&amp;iid=4992234\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 2019, earnings presentation</a>.</p> <p>On the cost side both gross margin and SG&amp;A spend was flat during FY17-19, resulting in an EBIT margin of 24.1% during FY19 (reported EBIT USD 3.4 billion as shown below).</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/1/966112-15857619993226206.png\" data-width=\"468\" data-height=\"139\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p>Source: ITW 10-K 2019, Author analysis.</p> <p>So given this flat EBIT development and mixed top-line results what happened with the stock price during 2017-2019?</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/1/saupload_i9gKymXe.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"930\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/1/saupload_i9gKymXe_thumb1.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"435\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW/charting\">Seeking Alpha</a>.</p> <p>An absolute roller-coaster ride, ITW went from $123 to $179 during 2017 (outperforming S&amp;P500, which was understandable given the strong top-line growth during 2017). As slower quarterly top-line growth was reported during<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 2018 the stock collapsed and at the zenith of general market panic (indicated by the massive drop in S&amp;P500 during H2 2018) the stock hit a bottom in December 2018 at $125.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As global recession fears evaporated and institutional capital came back to the Equity markets during Q1 2019, ITW followed the S&amp;P500 upwards finishing mid-February 2020 at $190. Which was very impressive given the weakness in reported top-line for FY19 discussed earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Coronavirus impact</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Peak euphoria mid-February turned into a free-fall with the stocking hitting $125 a month later, then a relief rally kicked in backed by massive stimulus spending promised by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52070718\" rel=\"nofollow\">every major government</a> in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-measures-f/factbox-germanys-anti-coronavirus-stimulus-package-idUSKBN21C26Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">the OECD</a>, the stock hit $143 a week ago and as of this writing trades at $137. Similar to the S&amp;P500 in general, Mr. Market has no clue how to value ITW with a longer outlook than 6 months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Projections</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given the free-fall in the stock price due to the coronavirus, many investors may feel it is undervalued and maybe are considering entering or adding to a current position, given ITW's long dividend track-record and earning power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Trying to value this stock I propose three scenarios depending on which shape the global macroeconomic recovery will have. The Base case corresponds to a U-shaped macroeconomic recovery in global GDP. The Bear case is the feared L-shape (similar to a depression) and the Bull case is the hope of a V-shaped recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In all of the scenarios I provide a table summarizing my valuation and how the Total Return to Shareholder (TRS) CAGR develops at the end of each table.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Base case (U-shape)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the U-shaped recovery I assume negative revenue growth of -5% during FY20 with a slow recovery, ending FY21 at approx. the same revenue figure as FY19. I also assume that minor improvements on amortization cost will safeguard the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I also assume CAPEX at 1.2x depreciation (which has been the average during the last three years), please note that the D&amp;A figures shown in the table below includes amortization of intangibles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the Invested Capital (IC) side I look at amortization of intangibles and working capital improvements driving IC down, slightly offset by PP&amp;E increase. Resulting in an impressive FY24 ROIC of 24.4% (my view on a typical ROIC for listed companies in general is 8-12%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So base case ITW will generate plenty of value for its shareholders, even during the coronavirus panic. Furthermore I assume a 50% payout ratio and aggressive share buy-back programs, which is a continuation of recent history for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a per-share basis I look at an intrinsic value of $156 year-end FY24 ($11 FCFE per share / 7% discount rate) and accumulated dividends of $22, which results in a nominal TRS of $41 given today's stock price of c. $137. Corresponding to a TRS CAGR of 5.3% over the next five years, which is below my target CAGR of 9% (which is the hurdle rate I use for investing in any stock).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/2/966112-15858161719241736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"914\" data-height=\"869\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/2/966112-15858161719241736.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Source: ITW 10-K, Author analysis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Bear case (L-shape)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Starting from the Base projections I assume the economic equivalent of \"Ragnar\u00f6k\" happens (for non-Nordic readers, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ragnr\u00f6k</a> is the Viking equivalent of Armageddon) entailing massive loss in global GDP and ensuing high global unemployment, translating into revenue growth of -10% FY20 and -5% FY21. Recovery begins in FY22 and FY24 revenue will equal FY19 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No improvements to gross margin nor SG&amp;A, however I assume minor improvements to EBIT due to lower amortization of intangibles cost.

Aggressive gross margin (+0.3% per annum) and SG&amp;A improvements (-0.8% per annum), drives EBIT margin from 24.1% to 30.3% during FY20-FY24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company maintains its 50% payout ratio and buy-back program, implying a TRS CAGR of 10.5% over the next five years. This is above my hurdle rate of 9%, as mentioned earlier. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a

href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW/earnings/estimates#figure_type=annual\">Seeking Alpha</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But of course, the uncertainty is enormous, will the coronavirus situation result in a U-shaped, V-shaped or L-shaped recovery?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nobody knows, but my opinion is that additional massive stimulus spending by OECD governments, for example, indicated by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1245000074167541761\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweets</a> made by the U.S. president, a surprise <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan-economy/taiwan-to-spend-35-billion-fighting-virus-to-donate-10-million-masks-idUSKBN21J41C\" rel=\"nofollow\">increase in stimulus</a> by Taiwan (Taiwan to spend $35 billion fighting virus) and also (to a lesser extent) IMF spending in <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/04/03/sp040320-opening-remarks-for-joint-imf-who-press-conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">developing countries</a> will result in a U-shaped recovery.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With regards to risk I have identified two large downside risk areas for the Base case projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Order backlog</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW services many different industries (the business is composed of 84 divisions operating in 53 countries) and as such it well-diversified over different sectors and geographies, however, as the company explains in its the <a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/IRW/Docs/4992234\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent 10-K</a>, just-in-time delivery is the default service model for most of the products ITW sells:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company's businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products. Total backlog was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Due to the predominately short-term nature of the Company's arrangements with its customers, backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2020 were not material as of December 31, 2019.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So a total backlog of $1.5 billion as at the end of 2019 would correspond to c. 10% of FY19 revenue. Everything else equal, this implies c. 5 weeks worth of production for ITW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hence, when a large Automaker such as Volkswagen announced in mid-March it would be <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/17/business/volkswagen-plants-europe-coronavirus/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">suspending its production</a> in Europe, that impact may not be recognized in the Q1 2020 financials but instead the full burden falls on Q2 2020 financials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hopefully management will give guidance on the order backlog size during the Q1 earnings call, since ITW does not provide this figure in its quarterly report. This figure would be a very good measure of the short-term fall in demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Raw material</strong> <strong>sourcing</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore one of the most important raw materials for the ITW manufactures is steel and since many European producers are <a href=\"https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3923785/Cadmium/Coronavirus-hits-more-steel-producers-in-Europe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">experiencing production issues</a>, the company may be exposed to supply risk in addition to a fall in demand. So even if they have a decent order book, e.g. in the Food equipment business, they may not have the ability to service that demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is a quality company with high earning power and high ROIC and in all of the scenarios I present the company will survive the coronavirus panic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Income investors may feel assured that their dividend will be paid, as an example the Bear case projection include $1.1 billion paid in dividend and $1.9 billion used for repurchasing shares during FY20.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the debt side, ITW had $7.8 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 2019. However, during FY20 the company is obligated to pay minimal principal payments on that debt ($4 million) and c. $200 million in interest payment, compared to its year-end 2019 $2 billion cash position I see no immediate default risk.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In summary, I view the stock as expensive and I would be looking at adding a position at levels below $115 per share, assuming my Base case holds. </p>", "twitContent": "$ITW -
