Take the case of <strong>Illinois Tool Works</strong> (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW\" title=\"Illinois Tool Works Inc.\">ITW</a></span>). It\u2019s both defensive (with incredible margins) and cyclical, and that cyclicality is going to lead to some eye-popping revenue contraction in the coming quarters as the company absorbs the brunt of downturns in markets like autos, food equipment, welding, and non-residential construction.</p> <p>Likewise, ITW isn\u2019t afraid to break from the pack and manage its business in a decidedly non-defensive way \u2013 instead of worrying about minimizing decremental margins for a few quarters, ITW is going to pass on significant structural changes and is instead going to focus on taking share from smaller competitors whose scale, liquidity, or other operational attributes are forcing them to play defense.</p> <p>I frankly love this move. I wish I loved the valuation as much. That\u2019s a familiar complaint with me and this stock (and with many others who follow ITW), but it\u2019s still relevant. Even if I assume ITW\u2019s strategy works and they can gain share sufficient to allow them to grow the top line at rates similar to high-quality peers like <strong>Dover</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>), <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>), or <strong>Parker Hannifin</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PH\" title=\"Parker-Hannifin Corporation\">PH</a>), I just can\u2019t get the numbers to work. Of course, I thought that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4313523-illinois-tool-works-is-margin-beast-valuation-is-little-scary\">back in late December</a>, and it didn\u2019t keep the stock from outperforming its peers by better than 12%.</p> <h2><strong>A Tough Quarter</strong></h2> <p>Where most multi-industrials posted decent beats against over-lowered expectations for the first quarter, ITW just squeaked by. Organic growth was not only worse than average (down 6.6% versus an average of down 4%), revenue missed expectations by close to 3%. On the other hand, management did well on margins, helped by</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Reputation, Strategic Differentiation Supporting Illinois Tool Works.
