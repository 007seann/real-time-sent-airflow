Still, this is a company with less long-term historical organic growth than you might assume, and I\u2019m modestly concerned that the company\u2019s relatively less-attractive end-market exposures may create some modest headwinds. My bigger issue remains valuation \u2013 priced for a mid-single-digit total annualized long-term return, I just don\u2019t see enough opportunity here to favor it over other industrials, even with the superior margins and quality ITW offers.</p> <h2><strong>Strong Results In Q4 And The Downturn Overall</strong></h2> <p>Illinois Tool Works had a very good quarter, with a decent 4% revenue beat magnified into an 11% beat at the segment income line due to strong cost performance. This latter point has really shone through during the downturn \u2013 ITW did a great job of managing costs during the downturn without a dramatic restructuring (firings/furloughs, major pay cuts, et al) and always stayed available to its customers, leading to market share gains that may well persist (particularly in the auto space).</p> <p>Revenue was down 1% yoy in organic terms (to $3.48B), falling in a sort of middle ground for the industrial sector but coming in about 4% better than expected. Operating income and segment income both rose 11% (to $0.88B and $0.90B, respectively), beating by 11%, with operating margin improving 160bp to 25.4% and segment margin improving 130bp to 25.8%.</p> <p>For the entire downturn, ITW\u2019s worst segment margin result was<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 17.7% in the second quarter \u2013 a level of profitability that many industrials would aspire to in periods of growth.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Leveraged To Grow Strongly In 2021</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While ITW has lagged <strong>3M</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMM\" title=\"3M Company\">MMM</a>) a bit in the recovery, that\u2019s entirely normal relative to other cycles, and ITW is setting up for a very strong 2021 that could well see organic growth outperform its \u201cmulti-industrial\u201d peers by 500bp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The auto business will likely be the strongest driver. Revenue grew 8% this quarter, comfortably ahead of production levels, with 20% growth in the China business. Although 3M\u2019s 18% growth in autos this quarter isn\u2019t a good comp, <strong>Stanley Black &amp; Decker</strong>\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWK\" title=\"Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\">SWK</a>) \u201chigh teens growth\u201d in fasteners is, and ITW did a little better than <strong>BorgWarner</strong>\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWA\" title=\"BorgWarner Inc.\">BWA</a>) 6% organic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the year ahead, ITW expects 14% to 18% growth in the auto business. While that\u2019s a little robust relative to some other auto-exposed companies that I\u2019ve covered recently, it\u2019s consistent with the IHS estimate of 14% production growth plus some market share gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Food equipment should also be much stronger in 2021, although off rough bottom. Revenue fell 19% this quarter, with sharp downturns in institutional and restaurant (down 30% and 30%-plus, respectively) only offset by growth in the retail channel (up 8%). A midpoint of 10% growth in 2021 seems attainable, particularly if retailers continue to invest in prepared food capacity, though I think restaurant spending will be weighted to the second half of the year and tied to the removal of pandemic-related capacity restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW management expects broadly similar 4% to 9% growth in the Test &amp; Measurement, Welding, and Polymers/Fluids business (5% to 9% for the first two, 4% to 8% for the latter). ITW outperformed <strong>Lincoln Electric</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LECO\" title=\"Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.\">LECO</a>) (down 2% to down 6%) and matched <strong>Colfax</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENOV\">CFX</a>) in welding, and I expect sales to recover with improving activity in areas like heavy machinery. T&amp;M and Polymers/Fluids are more broadly economically-exposed (though auto is a big part of Polymers/Fluids), and I fewer segment-specific drivers beyond the general recovery.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What About The Longer Term?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW has proven itself over and over again, and when it comes to industrial companies, few are run better \u2013 seriously, there isn\u2019t a long list of industrial companies that will likely generate 30%+ ROICs over the next three years, and particularly without significant software businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The \u201cbut\u201d is the question of ITW\u2019s leverage to growth markets. If you look at the end-markets that are likely to generate sustained growth above underlying IP, you end up with markets like automation, electrification, ESG (green industries like alternative energy and energy efficiency), and industrial software. ITW really doesn\u2019t play in those markets, and while it has gotten back to M&amp;A, the acquisition of <strong>Amphenol</strong>\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APH\" title=\"Amphenol Corporation\">APH</a>) MTS Test and Simulation business is a low-risk tuck-in/complementary deal for the T&amp;M business. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad deal, particularly given the substantial margin improvement potential (the business has a mid-single-digit operating margin), but it doesn\u2019t change the story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Before the assembled loyal ITW villagers go to sharpen the pitchforks and light the torches, I want to note that this is a potential issue for the stock, and not a sharp criticism of the company. ITW has done quite well with its business mix, but the fact remains that Wall Street is a \u201cwhat are you doing for me NOW?\u201d world, and these concerns do move stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW\u2019s outperformance in 2020 and strong recovery leverage in 2021 does lead me to move some numbers around, but the long-term picture doesn\u2019t change much (apart from adding in the acquired revenue). I\u2019m still looking for long-term revenue growth around 2% to 3%, with the possibility of outperformance driven by M&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On margins and cash flows, I do expect another point or so of improvement from 2021 to 2023 (or about 150bp from 2019), and I do expect FCF margins to move into the low 20%\u2019s over the next five years, driving a long-term FCF growth rate in the mid-single-digits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Neither discounted cash flow nor margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA suggest that ITW shares are undervalued now. Illinois Tool Works shares admittedly seldom trade cheaply, and the relative premium to the industrial space has certainly shrunk some, but I don\u2019t see a particularly attractive long-term annualized potential return. Perhaps a lower return is a fair trade for a stock that rarely surprises to the negative, but it isn\u2019t a combination that works for my needs today.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool
