During the 3Q FY 2021 release, ITW showed 8% total revenue growth with 12% growth ex-automotive segment which has seen big disruption to the supply chain primarily due to the ever increasing demand of chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From a business standpoint, Illinois Tool Works is a company that I'd like to own. They have a globally as well as economically diverse business that allows for some sectors to struggle, while others pick up the slack as evidenced by 3Q FY 2021.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend History</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A history of rising dividends is a quick way to narrow down the universe of stocks into those that likely have competitive advantages protecting their business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368733494071085.png\" alt=\"ITW Dividend History\" width=\"574\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works Investor Relations</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to the CCC list, Illinois Tool Works has increased their dividend payout for 50 consecutive years.

The average free cash flow payout ratios are 44.6% and 46.9%, respectively. ITW's dividend is well covered by both net income and free cash flow.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quantitative Quality</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My goal when I purchase a stake in a business is to own shares for years at a time. As such, I want to see how the business has performed over time in terms of its financials. As your holding period gets longer, it's the business quality and fundamentals that play a larger role than initial valuation in determining the returns you will see as an investor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368778334833984_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"461\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368778334833984.png\" alt=\"ITW Revenue Profits and Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW's revenue has stalled out over the last decade declining a total of 13.4% or ~1.6% annualized. Even going through FY 2019, the last pre-COVID year, revenue had declined 0.4% annually. Gross profits have fared better falling just 4.2% in total or ~0.5% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating profits showed impressive, respectively speaking, growth rising 22.1% in total over the last decade or ~2.2% annually. Meanwhile, operating cash flow rose 43.5% in total or ~4.1% annualized. Free cash flow has been the biggest beneficiary increasing 60.4% in total or ~5.4% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The following chart shows the rolling 5-year period CAGRs for revenue, gross and operating profits, and operating and free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368796333586526_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368796333586526.png\" alt=\"ITW 5 Year Financial CAGRs\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quality businesses will be able to turn fair amounts of sales into profits and cash flow.

The 10-year average gross margin is 40.5% with the 5-year average at 41.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Likewise, free cash flow margins have been climbing as well rising from 11.0% for FY 2011 to 20.4% in FY 2020. The 10-year average free cash flow margin for ITW is 14.7% with the 5-year average around 17%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF ROIC, is my preferred profitability metric. The FCF ROIC represents the amount of free cash flow the business is generating on the capital invested in the business. Similar to the free cash flow margin I expect to see stable or increasing FCF ROICs over time as the business is able to flex its proverbial muscles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368859133748257_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"668\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368859133748257.png\" alt=\"ITW Free Cash Flow Returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"391\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW has only dipped below 10% on FCF ROIC one year over the last decade, and FCF ROIC has steadily been climbing. The 10-year average FCF ROIC for ITW is 16.3% with the 5-year average up to 20.6%. Equally impressive is the substantial improvement in FCF ROA which has averages of 12.5% and 15.3%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To understand how ITW uses its free cash flow, I calculate three variations of the metric, defined below:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Free Cash Flow, FCF: Operating cash flow less capital expenditures</li> <li>Free Cash Flow after Dividend, FCFaD: FCF less total cash dividend payments</li> <li>Free Cash Flow after Dividend and Buybacks, FCFaDB: FCFaD less net cash spent on share repurchases</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Businesses that are able to produce more cash than the business can realistically re-invest in the business are prime candidates to reward owners with ample dividend growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368864150878162_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"698\" data-height=\"416\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/14/7257631-16368864150878162.png\" alt=\"ITW Free Cash Flows\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> <em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As we saw earlier, ITW has done a solid job growing their FCF over the last decade. During that time, they've generated a total of $20.5 B in FCF. With that $20.5 B in FCF, ITW has paid out a cumulative total of $9.1 B to shareholders in dividends, which puts the 10-year FCFaD at a healthy $11.4 B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW has been very aggressive with share repurchases, spending a total of $15.6 B on net buybacks over the last decade. That puts the cumulative FCFaDB at -$4.2 B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Buybacks can be an excellent way to return additional cash to shareholders an turbocharge the per share growth. As we saw above, ITW has been very aggressive with their cash return payout out at 120% of the free cash flow ITW has generated in total over the last decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/15/7257631-16369529260503418.png\" alt=\"ITW Shares Oustanding\" width=\"610\" height=\"378\" loading=\"lazy\"> <em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The share buybacks have reduced the shares outstanding by 35.6% in total over the last decade or 4.8% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since my equity investment is lower in the capital structure and doesn't get paid unless everyone else has been first, I want to make sure the balance sheet doesn't appear to be too heavily levered. My preference is to see stable debt-to-capitalization ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/15/7257631-16369552902782915.png\" alt=\"ITW Debt to Capitalization\" width=\"592\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\"> <em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW's debt-to-capitalization ratio has been rising over the last decade increasing from 28% in FY 2011 to 72% for FY 2020. The 10-year average debt-to-capitalization ratio for ITW is 55% with the 5-year average at 69%. While the debt-to-capitalization ratio has been increasing, that's more of a function of the large share repurchases completed over the last decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The net debt ratios are a better clue to just how leveraged the business is. Generally, the more stable a business's operations, the higher leverage that can be safely put against the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/15/7257631-16369593004139514.png\" alt=\"ITW Debt Ratios\" width=\"576\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\"> <em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works SEC filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite the rising debt-to-capitalization ratio, the net debt ratios are still fairly conservative. The 10 year average net debt-to-EBITDA, net debt-to-operating income, and net debt-to-free cash flow ratios are 1.3x, 1.5x and 2.1x, respectively. Likewise, the 5-year averages are 1.5x, 1.7x, and 2.4x.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuing a potential investment is a tricky matter, which is why I like to use several valuation methods to attempt to hone in on a potential entry point. The valuation methods that I use are the minimum acceptable rate of return, MARR, analysis, dividend yield theory, the dividend discount model, and a reverse discounted cash flow analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a company will provide. You can then apply a reasonable expected terminal multiple on those future earnings and calculate what the expected return is. If the expected return is lower than your minimum return for investment, you wait for the valuation proposition to change while seeking out other opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On average, analysts expect ITW to report FY 2021 EPS of $8.46 and FY 2022 EPS of $9.06. Analysts also expect ITW to be able to grow EPS 8.6% annually through FY 2025. I then assumed that ITW's EPS growth would decline to 5.0% annually for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 55% payout ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As you can seen in the following YChart, market participants have typically valued ITW between ~10x and ~25x TTM EPS. I'll examine terminal multiples spanning that range in the MARR analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"></p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/16/saupload_70423bf549305990109972f87333a849.png\" alt=\"ITW stock valuation\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in ITW could generate provided the assumptions laid out above are reasonable forecasts for the future.

The concept is simple and straightforward that market participants will collectively value a business' dividend stream around the same over time. For ITW, I'll use the 3-year average yield as the proxy for the fair value of the shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/15/7257631-16369650670073593.png\" alt=\"Illinois Tool Works Dividend Yield Theory\" width=\"562\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Image Source: Author; Data Source: Illinois Tool Works Investor Relations and Yahoo Finance</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW shares currently offer a forward dividend yield of 2.05% compared to the 3-year average yield of 2.45%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dividend discount model is a short-hand valuation method based solely off the dividends that a business will produce. The downside to the DDM is that it assumes a constant dividend growth rate in perpetuity, and like all versions of DCFs, small changes to the inputs can result in big changes to the results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/22/7257631-16375821203468244.png\" alt=\"Illinois Tool Works Dividend Discount Model\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\"><em>Source: Author</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Using the current annual dividend of $4.88 with an estimated long-term dividend growth rate of 7.5% and a 10% discount rate, shares of ITW are worth ~$210 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A reverse discounted cash flow analysis is the technically correct way to value an investment. Unfortunately, the DCF model is difficult to implement due to the high degree of uncertainty among the inputs. However, the model can still be used to decipher what the current market valuation implies about the future cash flows of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I use a simplified DCF model based on revenue growth and an initial free cash flow margin of 18.6% that increases to 22.5% by the end of the forecast period, and a 3.5% terminal growth rate. With a 10% discount rate ITW needs to grow revenues <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/attachments/download/29269\">10.6%</a> annually during the forecast period to justify the current market valuation. Reducing the discount rate to 8% drops the required revenue growth rate to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/attachments/download/29270\">4.9%</a> annually to support the current valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is a diversified industrial company with their hands in many sectors of the economy. ITW has exposure to the automotive industry, construction, food equipment, testing equipment and many others. Their patent portfolio numbering &gt;18k helps to defend the position of many of their products and processes. That diversified portfolio helps to keep the business moving forward even if one sector is going through a rough patch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite revenue growth being non-existent over the last decade, ITW has done an admirable job growing profits and cash flow further down the financial statements. And especially so on a per share basis with the massive share repurchases undertaken over that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW's free cash flow margins and returns have steadily been improving over the last decade. In spite of a difficult 2020, ITW was still able to hit 20%+ on both metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $181 and $221. The MARR analysis based on a 10% IRR 5 years from now with a terminal multiple ranging from 17.5x to 22.5x puts the fair value range at between $153 and $191. Lowering the required return to 8% increases the price you could buy shares today to $166 to $208, still well below the current price near $239.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is one of the better industrial dividend growth businesses out there. Unfortunately, the current market valuation seems well ahead of a reasonable price to pay for ITW, given its likely growth trajectory. Unless you expect growth to come in substantially higher, returns are likely to be muted from here with valuation being a drag on future returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On top of that, I expect share repurchases to continue; albeit at a slower pace. Based on TTM free cash flow after the dividend of ~$1.2 B even if all of that excess cash flow was devoted to buybacks, only approximately 1.6% of shares outstanding could be retired.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Give the elevated valuation which has pushed the dividend yield down and lowered the impact of share repurchases, Illinois Tool Works appears to be a hold at the current prices. I would feel comfortable adding shares to my portfolio on a pull back close to $200 or lower, which represents a 16% decline from current levels.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works:
