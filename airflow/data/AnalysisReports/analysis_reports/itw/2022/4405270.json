The company has roughly 45,000 employees, 18,000 granted and pending patents, and operations in 55 countries. The company generates 53% of its sales in North America, 28% in EMEA countries, and 19% in APAC countries.</p> <p>ITW is more than an auto supplier as only 22% of its sales are generated in the automotive industry.

What ITW does is working together with key customers. This ensures a better relationship with customers and allows the company to invest in the right areas, which will eventually end up increasing R&amp;D efficiency. This is actually a trend that has been going on for years. I studied the process and benefits of supplier-customer relations during my master's and ITW might be one of the best examples of this. If you want more info on this topic, feel free to read this <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233542475_Accessing_Supplier_Innovation_By_Being_Their_Preferred_Customer\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a>. Note that it's one of many<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> examples, and a paywall may apply.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">2020 Was Bad, But A Good Example Of ITW's Strengths</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With that being said, 2020 was bad. Almost all capital expenditure (\"CapEx\") intensive industries were hit hard by lower demand - at least the industries that ITW services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In 2020, total sales declined by 11% to $12.6 billion. This decline was caused by a decline of 10% in organic growth and divestitures that were responsible for another 100 basis points. As the graph below shows, 2020 was the second straight year of lower sales after the global economic peak of 2018. Back then, sales peaked at $14.8 billion. Another thing worth mentioning is that sales haven't gone anywhere for roughly 14 years. Even 2018 wasn't higher than 2010 when the global economy started to heat up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129688491690955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129688491690955.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: TIKR.com</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating income, however, has not gone sideways. Thanks to cost-cutting measures and overall efficiency enhancement, the company has managed to grow margins significantly. During the 2018 peak, operating margins were at 24.4%, which was 10 points higher compared to 2010. Unfortunately, the recent decline in global growth has pushed margins down to 22.9%, which resulted in a total operating income of $2.9 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129691690387394_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129691690387394.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: TIKR.com</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Keep in mind that margins would have been much worse if it weren't for 120 basis points tailwinds from enterprise initiatives. That's why, going forward, the company is positive that it can achieve operating margins of 24% to 25% in 2021 with support from another 100 basis points in enterprise initiatives. That said, the company also expects between 7% and 10% in organic sales growth, which should lead to 9%-12% total sales growth to at least $13.7 billion in sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With that in mind, the good news is that the company has a long history of rising margins and the ability to quickly recover from a year like 2020 if economic growth is able to significantly recover in 2021, which I believe it will.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">More good news is that the company has the ability to generate a lot of shareholder value beyond strong capital gains - this is the part I missed in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite being highly cyclical, ITW is currently generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow (2020 result). This is one of the highest results ever and one of the benefits from lower CapEx. Expectations are that free cash flow is going to advance to more than $2.7 billion in 2022 as CapEx is expected to remain subdued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/saupload_5844a03b684ce7d75c646e7b31f5a9c3.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"436\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The graph below shows (partially) what the company does when it generates cash. Note that 2020 is not included as most websites do not have access to 2020 data yet. However, that doesn't matter as I have the data anyway. In 2020, the company spent $706 million on share buybacks. This is down from $1.5 billion in 2019. Dividends were 7% higher bringing total shareholder distributions to roughly $2.1 billion. This is down from $2.8 billion in 2019 when the company distributed more cash than it made in free cash flow. Note that dividends per share have grown by 7.8% CAGR since 2004.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129736793359888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-16129736793359888.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: TIKR.com</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is one of the reasons why the company's financial situation has deteriorated. In 2020, excess cash flow was used to lower net debt by roughly $400 million. This was the first (significant) decline since 2012. Meanwhile, total equity (assets minus liabilities) are up almost $200 million, but still well below its multi-year highs. Nonetheless, and this is important, the company remains in excellent financial health. Net-debt/equity is at just 1.7x while EBIT is covering interest expenses 14x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-161297447207279_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/31557165-161297447207279.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: TIKR.com</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unfortunately, the stock isn't cheap.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's start by mentioning that the company's 2.2% yield is not at multi-year lows. While it is well off the 2020 highs of 3.5%, it's roughly 60 basis points above its 2018 lows. Unfortunately, it gets worse from here. The company is trading at 30.8x LTM earnings and 21.4x EBITDA (18.9x NTM EBITDA).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/saupload_f96e4fcbfe67754471d46a6adb2bb977.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"453\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I put ITW on my long-term watchlist as I am willing to start a significant position as soon as the stock sells off more than 20%. This almost inclusively happens during a (manufacturing) recession and has happened 4 times since the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/saupload_ITWm120001656i.png\" data-width=\"992\" data-height=\"520\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: FINVIZ</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Normally, long-term investing should not be dependent on timing as most investors are bad at timing. However, ITW is a perfect stock to buying during a severe sell-off. As much as I like dividend growth and free cash flow, I am not forced to put money to work. Besides that, I am already overweight industrials, which means some of my next purchases will be defensive (among others).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/10/saupload_40dac2b87cd316c3e8c43d0ca5269fe1.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This brings me to my final thoughts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works is more than an industrial supplier. The company has figured out a way to consistently improve margins throughout multiple cycles and generate free cash flow of more than 100% of net income. The company uses this cash to maintain its 50+ year dividend growth streak and to buy back shares. And even though net debt has risen until 2020, the company's balance sheet is extremely healthy and leaves room for new investments - if needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unfortunately, the stock isn't cheap after its rally in 2020. Therefore, I suggest that investors who aren't long the stock put this stock on their watchlist. While time in the market generally speaking beats timing the market, I highly value having a list of great stocks on a watchlist to go bargain hunting whenever the market offers us new opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let me know what you think!</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Thank you very much for reading.
