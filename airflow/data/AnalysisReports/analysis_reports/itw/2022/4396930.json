ITW shares are a macro play as much as they are a company-specific trade.</p> <p>Having said that, I think that the naysayer had it wrong about the company's valuation. There are four good reasons the company trades above industry-average price multiples.</p> <ol> <li>Higher dividend yield</li> <li>Lower leverage</li> <li>Higher margins</li> <li>Share repurchases</li> </ol> <p>I believe that ITW shares will perform in line with the broader market.</p> <h2>Company overview</h2> <p>If there is one word to describe ITW, it would be <em>decentralized. The company</em> consists of hundreds of small businesses that build:</p> <ol> <li>Automobile parts</li> <li>Kitchen appliances (refrigerators, dishwashers)</li> <li>Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics</li> <li>Welding products</li> <li>Chemicals</li> <li>Construction products</li> </ol> <p>The decentralized structure is important, given the diverse end markets that ITW serves. The businesses are autonomous as can be, given the company's strategic plans. The company sells branded products such as Hobart, Miller Electric, Paslode<strong>,</strong> and unbranded parts used by companies such as Ford (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>) and Boeing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>).</p> <p>The company's performance will depend on the level of activity in its end markets established above.</p> <h2><strong>Revenue Analysis</strong></h2> <p>In the first quarter, economic disruptions in China and other parts of Asia negatively affected ITW's revenue, which declined 10% during the quarter.</p> <p>Revenue from auto parts was hit the hardest decreasing 13.6%, as car manufacturers decreased car build-ups in anticipation of lower demand due to the pandemic.</p> <p>In the second quarter, revenues were down 26% as the pandemic reached Europe and the U.S. Sales from the auto parts and kitchen appliances segments decreased the most as car manufacturers lowered production and restaurants closed, in keeping with the lockdown rules.</p> <p>In the third quarter, revenue increased considerably compared to the previous quarter but was 4% lower<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> compared to the same quarter last year. The sequential improvement was in line with the general economic activity as governments lifted social distancing rules. The construction and chemicals segment improved the most, and sales from these two segments were higher than the previous quarter last year, partially offsetting the year-on-year decline in the other segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I imagine that the construction sector saw an increase in demand as construction contractors ramped up work to compensate for the forgone time during the lockdown. The chemicals sector improved as manufacturers stocked in raw materials and built inventories in anticipation of higher production demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Peer Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">TWI trades on a higher price multiple than its peers. Dover Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>), Fortive Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTV\" title=\"Fortive Corporation\">FTV</a>), and Parker-Hannifin Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PH\" title=\"Parker-Hannifin Corporation\">PH</a>) all have a similar revenue growth rate to TWI. Still, all trade at a lower PE ratio than the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The first possible explanation for ITW's above-average valuation is its low debt. Among its peers with comparable revenue growth, TWI has the lowest debt to equity ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/12/29/saupload_ea14c3df5aa53c24e97142018b5140bc.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\">Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another possible reason for the higher PE is the dividend yield. Again, it has a higher dividend ratio among its peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">TWI has the highest profit margin. The company touts its management strategy which focuses on value-added products that allow the company to charge higher margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/12/29/saupload_76a0c00deb2358a0e81f096e2435c920.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Share repurchase</h2> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup><col span=\"5\"></colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><strong>9-months ending Sept. 2020</strong></td> <td><strong>2019</strong></td> <td><strong>2018</strong></td> <td><strong>2017</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Share repurchases (millions)</strong></td> <td>$706</td> <td>$1,500</td> <td>$2,000</td> <td>$1,000</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sourced from company financial statements</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has an investor-friendly share repurchase program that supports its share price and valuation. I expect the company to purchase around $300 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the year's total purchases in line with the historical average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The number of shares has been declining for the past ten years as a result of the share repurchase program as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/12/29/saupload_315591f6eb304db1c20dad3db1e46ce4.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">How I might be wrong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I argue in this piece that ITW will perform in line with the market, contrary to a broadly-held view that the company is overvalued. I might be wrong, and shares of ITW might underperform the market for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One possible risk is the digitalization trends that push tech stock higher, while industrial stocks remain flat. We have seen this happening in the second quarter, as lockdown rules led to a surge in demand for digital solutions. Many analysts expect digitalization trends to continue, and the general market might outperform ITW, especially given the weight of tech stock in many indexes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Half of ITW's revenues come from abroad, exposing the company to currency risks. Central banks around the world ventured on unprecedented monetary easing which might destabilize currency rates. We have seen the value of gold <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\">(</a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a>) surge this year as monetary risks rise. There hasn't been a major disruption yet, but sometimes, monetary imbalances take time to boil into a market disruptive event. These risks are more serious for cyclical stocks such as ITW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The high dividend, share repurchases, high margins, and low debt are all factors that justify ITW's price premium. But this analysis is based given a certain level of growth that the company was able to secure in the past five years. If management growth initiates fail, or if investors perceive them to be unsuccessful, shares might underperform the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, if the results of the fourth quarter disappoint investors, ITW might fall. This is a real possibility given the recent increase in COVID infections and subsequent lockdowns and social distancing rules which might translate to lower demand in the fourth quarter. The company usually announces fourth quarter results in the last week of January.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Summary</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is a manufacturing conglomerate with a strong balance sheet and international operations that enabled it to withstand the pandemic. Still, the cyclical nature of its operations means that ITW's shares will perform in line with the general market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is trading at higher price multiples than its peers. This is possible because of its lower debt, higher dividends, profit margins, and an investor-friendly share repurchase program. I believe that ITW's shares will maintain this premium above its peers' shares.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - The Reasons Illinois Tool Works Is More Valuable Than Its Peers. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396930-reasons-illinois-tool-works-is-valuable-peers?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "105667", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "306833", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2752", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "8501", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "568977", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "2660", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "603217", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17917", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4396930-reasons-illinois-tool-works-is-valuable-peers", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396930-reasons-illinois-tool-works-is-valuable-peers", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/12/29/saupload_ea14c3df5aa53c24e97142018b5140bc.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/12/29/saupload_ea14c3df5aa53c24e97142018b5140bc.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "105667", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "bashar-issa", "userId": 50313618, "tagId": 603217, "bio": "Bashar is a contributing writer at Seeking Alpha, focusing on Long/Short investment ideas, with a geographic focus in North America.
