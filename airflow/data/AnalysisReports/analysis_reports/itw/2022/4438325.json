SG&amp;A is steadily 17% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW expects 10-12% full year organic growth, 25-26% operating margin, and $8.20-$8.60 GAAP EPS.

Customer insights drive ITW's innovation, including 18,500 granted and pending patents;</li> <li>ITW's <strong>Decentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture </strong>reflects a flexible business model that executes the company\u2019s strategy and values to best serve customers. Execution of a focused, simple organizational structure delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each end market.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Strengths</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW is a serial innovator, evidenced by 1,900 new patent applications in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CEO Scott Santi, 59, said in the Q1 call, \"We source where we produce.\u201d ITW carries \"surplus capacity (of) 15% to 20%\u2026. we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday\u2026 (by having) ample extra capacity to flex.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Michael Larsen, 52, gave 35-40% margin estimates, expecting \"really strong performance ... as the recovery takes hold.\u201d</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Weaknesses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Larsen said their Automotive segment will have the most margin pressure \"given the nature of the business and how contracts are structured....\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Food Equipment was hard hit by the pandemic. In the Q1 call, analyst Ann Duignan asked, \"What about \u2026 restaurants (that) cannot hire\u2026?\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analyst Julian Mitchell asked if receivables caused \"flattish\" Q1 cash flow. Larsen said, \"As sales grow, inventories and receivables grow. \u2026 receivable aging and our bad debt ... are (meaningfully) below pre-COVID levels.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW intends to \"Win the Recovery\" with its decentralized, entrepreneurial culture that executes \"flexibility within the framework\" for better performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the Q1 call, Santi said one to three <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/buyer-of-eden-prairie-s-mts-swings-second-deal-for-its-biggest-business/600013988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTS type deals</a> annually is reasonable, but Santi said, \u201cWe (will not) buy anything to consolidate.... we compete based on our ability to deliver superior value to the customers.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Asked about large acquisitions, Santi said, \"I don\u2019t think size is a barrier .... We have never been more prepared ... a result of the last nine years of work on this.\u201d (The primary question is) \"does it fit an area of the market we think has long-term above market organic growth prospects\u2026.\u201d</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Threats</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">China poses ITW's greatest potential threat in the form of their government exerting control over their companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW's largest segment (Automotive OEM) has the threat of general uncertainty in the automobile market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Asked about electric-powered vehicles, Santi said, \"(Some of what) we do around the powertrain now \u2026 wouldn\u2019t exist, but there\u2019s a whole range of new\u2026 applications in the EV space.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">F.A.S.T. Graph</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The graph below shows ITW's strength following the Spring 2020 downturn. The company appears well-positioned to ramp up profits by maximizing the benefits of its decade-long focus on its business model, with a current emphasis on maximizing organic growth in all its divisions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/7/6/589494-16255784208824084_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1970\" data-height=\"1520\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/7/6/589494-16255784208824084.png\" alt=\"ITW FAST Graph\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>From F.A.S.T. Graphs</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Dividend</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current quarterly dividend is $1.14, annualized to $4.56. ITW's 5-year dividend growth rate is 15.69%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If ITW meets the midpoint of 2021 GAAP EPS guidance of $8.40, the payout ratio for the current dividend would be 54.29%. The 5-year average payout ratio has been 53.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At a July 7 closing price of $225.21, the current yield is 2.02%. The 5-year average high yield was 3.12%, with the highest yield of 3.8% in 2020.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Personal Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works is 3.3% of my 24-stock retirement income portfolio. I use eight factors to rate these companies:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>S&amp;P Credit Rating. ITW's A+ rating scores 5 points on a scale ranging from 9 points for AAA to 1 point for BBB.</li> <li>Consecutive Years of Dividend Increases. I divide this number by 10, so ITW's 46 years equal a score of 4.6. The portfolio range is 0.9 to 6.5.</li> <li>Current Dividend Yield. ITW's $225.21 closing price on 7/7/21 translates to a 2.02% yield. I multiply by 100 for a score of 2.02. The portfolio yields range from 0.61% to 5.47%, so scores for this factor are 0.61 to 5.47.</li> <li>Payout Ratio. I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' earnings estimates. ITW's estimated adjusted EPS is $11.40. The $4.56 dividend is 40.00% of this estimate. A low payout ratio gives more flexibility for dividend growth. I subtract the payout ratio from 100%, which for ITW is 60.0%. I multiply this by 10, giving ITW a 6.0 payout ratio score. Scores for this factor range from 1.4 to 8.5.</li> <li>Five-year Dividend Growth Rate. I use Seeking Alpha's data. To maintain parity with other factors, I multiply the growth rate by 0.5. For example, ITW's 5-year dividend growth rate is 15.69%, or 15.69, which I multiply by 0.5, for a score of 7.845. Scores range from 0.8 to 10.9.</li> <li>The Quant Score from Seeking Alpha. This is \"an objective, unemotional evaluation of each stock based on over 100 metrics, such as the company's financial statement, stock price performance, and analysts' estimates of the company's future revenue and earnings, relative to other companies in the stock's sector. The rating is from 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0 being very bearish and 5.0 being very bullish.\" For example, ITW's quant score is 3.16.</li> <li>Dividend Safety Score. This is from Simply Safe Dividends, which rates the safety of a company's dividend on a score of 0 to 100, with 50 being average. For parity, I divide the dividend safety score by 10. For example, Illinois Tool Works' dividend safety score of 81 becomes 8.1.</li> <li>Long-term Debt to Total Capital. I use Seeking Alpha for this metric. Lower is better, (like the payout ratio), so I subtract ITW's 67.70 LT debt from 100%, to get 32.30%. I multiply by 10, giving ITW a score of 3.23</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These eight factors give ITW a combined score of 39.96, which ranks ITW 11th among the 24 portfolio companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q2 Portfolio Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On 6/30/21, the portfolio's 24 equities had a 3.18% aggregate yield. The year-to-date gain has been 11.4%. The cash position is 2.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Below. <em>PRICE</em> is the 6/30/21 closing price. <em>%PORT</em> is the percentage of the portfolio's market value. <em>DIV</em> is the annual dividend per share. <em>YLD </em>is the 6/30/21 yield. <em>%INC</em> is the percentage of income from each company. <em>S&amp;P</em> is the credit rating. <em>YRS</em> is the consecutive years of dividend increases, per Justin Law and the Canadian Dividend All-Star list. <em>SSD</em> is the Dividend Safety number from Simply Safe Dividends. <em>SCORE</em> is described in the ITW section (above).</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td>EQUITY</td> <td>PRICE</td> <td>%PORT</td> <td>DIV</td> <td>YLD</td> <td>%INC</td> <td>S&amp;P</td> <td>YRS</td> <td>SSD</td> <td>SCORE</td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Johnson &amp;

This great REIT has continued to go up, but I opted for a higher yield.</li> <li>Verizon Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>) closed in April at $57.42, held 11 months, for a gain of 3.7%, ex-dividends. It will be increasingly capital intensive and difficult to regain an A- S&amp;P credit rating.</li> <li>AT&amp;T (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) closed in April at $29.98, held (this time) 11 months, for a gain of 6.7%, ex-dividends.

It has powerful scale and unmatched proprietary data economic data.</li> <li>Toronto-Dominion Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TD\" title=\"The Toronto-Dominion Bank\">TD</a>), in April at $65.68, shortly after highlighting TD in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4417449-toronto-dominion-q1-2021-portfolio-review\">Q1 Portfolio Review</a>. I like the sale of TD Ameritrade to Schwab (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHW\" title=\"The Charles Schwab Corporation\">SCHW</a>), and TD's 13% stake in Schwab. TD has an AA- S&amp;P credit rating.</li> <li>Royal Bank of Canada (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RY\" title=\"Royal Bank of Canada\">RY</a>), in June at $102.29. It has quality, yield, and the favorable environment for big Canadian banks.

I like management and scale after acquiring Vereit. The stand-alone REIT sub-sector offers flexibility in a changing retail environment.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In Q2, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PNW\" title=\"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\">PNW</a>) was added in June at $82.71.
