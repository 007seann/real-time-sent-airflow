Needless to say, ITW is a<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> stock that may check off a lot of boxes for investors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As shown below, ITW has produced outsized returns for investors over the past decade, with a 358% total return, far surpassing the 225% return of the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>). In this article, I highlight whether the stock is currently a buy or hold, so let's get started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904905782354_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"357\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904905782354.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Total Return (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Why ITW?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works may be a relative unknown for some investors, but it's indeed a Fortune 200 global industrial giant with 45,000 employees, serving multiple economic sectors. This includes automotive, food equipment, electronics, welding, polymers and fluids, construction, and specialty products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While ITW is a cyclical company, its management has done a good job of leveraging technology to drive scale and process efficiencies. This is reflected by the significant ramp-up in operating leverage at the company, with margin improving substantially over the past 10 years, from 16.8% to 23.3%, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904631583092_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"557\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904631583092.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Revenue and Op Margin (YCharts)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This helps ITW to drive more value to the bottom line for shareholders and is reflected by its A grade for Profitability. ITW produces a sector-leading EBITDA and Net Income margins of 26% and 17.5%, respectively, far surpassing that of the sector medians, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904416023781_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"479\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904416023781.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Profitability (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, ITW has demonstrated impressive growth that's outpaced inflation, with revenue growing by 13% YoY (16% on an organic basis) to $4.0 billion in the third quarter. This was partly driven by the acquisition of MTS, which contributed 3% to revenue, and by double-digit organic growth in five out of ITW's seven segments. Moreover, had it not been for unfavorable currency (due to a stronger dollar), revenue would have been 6% higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Notably, it also generated record operating income of $983 million, representing a 16% increase over the prior-year period, and importantly, ITW continues to demonstrate efficient scale, as operating margin improved by 70 basis points to 24.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking ahead to fourth quarter results, ITW expects to see a strong finish to the year. However, there is potential for an economic slowdown this year, which may pressure operating fundamentals. This question was brought up during the last conference call, with management highlighting its flexible cost structure and 80/20 (20% of customers generate 80% of revenues) that makes it more resilient to downturns, noting as follows during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548992-illinois-tool-works-inc-itw-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548992-illinois-tool-works-inc-itw-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q&amp;A section</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p><strong>Q:</strong> It seems like we're walking into a construction recession. How do you get ahead of that so that you can limit the impact of it?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Well, we've talked about this before, but one of the fundamental elements of 80/20 is that we have a very flexible cost structure. So we do a lot of outsourcing upstream. We want to assemble. We want to control the manufacturing elements that really matter from the standpoint of control of quality-controlled delivery. But we don't necessarily have to bend all the metal. We don't have to necessarily do all the upstream work.</p> <p>And so what that gets us fundamentally, is a relatively flexible cost structure. So we are a read and react company. Our businesses are going to respond to whatever the demand is that sits right in front of them. We've talked about that before. We don't do a lot of forward forecasting. We are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. And as demand rates start to decline in places like construction, then those adjustments will take place real time.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, ITW carries a very strong A+ rated balance sheet. Its 2.3% dividend yield is also well-covered by a 57% payout ratio and comes with a 5-year CAGR of 12.1%. As shown below, ITW scores A and B grades for dividend safety, growth yield, and consistency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904140355206_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"342\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747904140355206.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Dividend Grades (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the dividend yield isn't high, it's worth noting that management tries to balance payouts with share buybacks, which are a more tax-efficient form of capital return. As shown below, ITW has meaningfully reduced its outstanding float by 9.5% over the past five years alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747903944630153_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747903944630153.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Shares Outstanding (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My only complaint with ITW is its valuation, which at $228.67 seems pricey with a forward PE of 24.4. As shown below, this sits above ITW's long-term normal PE of 21.5. Moreover, at the current high PE, ITW is only getting a 4% earnings yield, which isn't enough to move the needle much. Plus, given the cyclical nature of ITW's business, it may be closer to the top of the cycle than the bottom. As such, I believe investors should wait for at least a 10% to 15% drop in price before initiating a position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747903737561347_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"500\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/26/49839830-16747903737561347.png\" alt=\"itw stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW Valuation (FAST Graphs)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investor Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ITW has a strong track record of market-beating returns, driven by a diversified and moat-worthy business model with a flexible operating structure. However, while ITW has demonstrated strong execution, it appears that's been fully baked into the share price, without consideration to the cyclical nature of the business and potential for economic softness in the near term. As such, investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position on this dividend aristocrat.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works: A Dividend King To Buy At The Right Price. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572950-illinois-tool-works-a-dividend-king-to-buy-at-the-right-price?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<h2><strong>Gen Alpha Teams Up With Income Builder</strong></h2><p>Gen Alpha has teamed up with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1396&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\"><strong>Hoya Capital</strong></a><b> </b>to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.
