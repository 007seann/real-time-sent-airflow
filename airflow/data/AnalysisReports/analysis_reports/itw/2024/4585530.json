Still, when it comes<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to stocks, there gets to be a point where elevated multiples are difficult to sustain no matter what the quality, and I fear that </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works </strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content invisible\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW\" title=\"Illinois Tool Works Inc.\">ITW</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) is there. While ITW has a strong record across many metrics, including share growth, margin improvement, and ROIC, that has really translated into free cash flow, and ITW lacks leverage to attractive secular growth opportunities that could argue for a premium multiple.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408285-illinois-tool-works-offers-sharp-short-cycle-recovery-exposure-robust-valuation\">my last article</a>, ITW shares have risen about 18%, modestly outperforming the industrial sector, but lagging names I\u2019ve preferred like <strong>Dover</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>), <strong>Eaton</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETN\" title=\"Eaton Corporation plc\">ETN</a>), and <strong>Schneider</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBGSY\" title=\"Schneider Electric S.E.\">OTCPK:SBGSY</a>). At this point, I can\u2019t find much value in the shares, and while I can see some \u201csafe haven\u201d appeal on the basis of proven management skill, weakening short-cycle end-markets are still a threat in my opinion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Less Attractive Cycle Leverage</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Relative to companies like Dover, Eaton, <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>), and Schneider, one of my concerns about ITW is the disconnect in valuation relative to likely long-term growth and margins. While I\u2019ll discuss the margin opportunities in a moment, I do think it\u2019s an issue that Illinois Tool Works doesn\u2019t have much leverage to long-term \u201csuper-cycles\u201d.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Some of my favored long-term markets include automation, electrification (ranging from buildings to factories to renewables and vehicles), aerospace, HVAC, life sciences, and clean energy, and ITW doesn\u2019t offer much leverage to any of this. There are some elevated content growth opportunities for the Auto segment from electrification and the Test &amp; Measurement business should likewise benefit from electrification trends, but there\u2019s not a lot else beyond that. Welding should benefit from structuring infrastructure activity in 2024 and beyond, and offers some leverage to a capex super-cycle (if we get one), but that\u2019s about as far as it goes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Likewise with more near-term trends. ITW isn\u2019t really leveraged to aerospace, agricultural equipment, mining, oil/gas, or renewables, and those are likely to be some of the stronger markets in 2023 and into 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works has meaningful exposure to the auto sector (around 25% of revenue, including aftermarket), and that\u2019s fine. While several companies (ranging from <strong>BorgWarner </strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWA\" title=\"BorgWarner Inc.\">BWA</a>) to <strong>Infineon </strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IFNNY\" title=\"Infineon Technologies AG\">OTCQX:IFNNY</a>) to <strong>Sensata</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ST\" title=\"Sensata Technologies Holding plc\">ST</a>)) have offered cautious commentary on auto build volume expectations in 2023, I expect it will be a relatively healthy market. While I\u2019m not quite as bullish on food equipment, I think underlying trends are improving and ITW has attractive share gain opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Beyond that, though, I have concerns about the company\u2019s exposure to construction \u2013 a residential slowdown is already playing out, and I expect non-residential to weaken further. Likewise, short-cycle industrial is around 15% of the business, and I expect that to weaken as 2023 goes on. There\u2019s a further hodgepodge beyond that, with stronger markets like food &amp; beverage offset by weaker markets like consumer durables (appliances, furniture, et al) and semiconductors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Margins Are Good, But Free Cash Flow Conversion Has Been Less Consistent</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I do give ITW management high marks for operational execution. There\u2019s a nearly relentless focus on margins across the company\u2019s operations, and they\u2019re often willing to forego revenue growth to maintain margins and returns. While progress has been somewhat choppy, and post-pandemic inflation certainly hasn\u2019t helped, operating margins have improved from the high teens to the mid-20%\u2019s over the past decade and management believes there\u2019s still room for further improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Those margins haven\u2019t always led to consistently better free cash flows, though. Free cash flow margins have continued to average out toward the mid-teens, and free cash flow has actually shrunk a bit over the past decade. The need to build inventories to offset supply chain risk has definitely played a role, and FCF had been trending up from the mid-teens to 20% in the years leading into the pandemic, but I\u2019d still like to see more improvement here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At this point, I\u2019m modeling a 20%-plus FCF margin in FY\u201923 as I expect ITW to be able to release some of that excess working capital, and I expect a \u201creset\u201d to the high teens the year after, with improvement toward the low-20%\u2019s through the next decade.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I have no doubt that there are readers who believe Illinois Tool Works\u2019 lack of leverage to super-cycles is a positive. After all, these megatrends may disappoint and companies may invest considerable resources (M&amp;A, capex, R&amp;D, et al) chasing rainbows. By comparison, ITW has more of a \u201ccast of thousands\u201d makeup to its growth, and I have no real concerns about ITW\u2019s ability to grow at a \u201cmarket-plus\u201d rate in the future (with GDP or industrial production as a baseline and ITW doing a little better than that).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Still, a history of relatively limited organic revenue growth should matter, particularly as further margin leverage is going to get harder to come by (for a highly-efficient company like ITW, there\u2019s a limit to how much better it can get). At this point, I\u2019m expecting long-term revenue growth around 4%, with about 50bp-100bp of FCF growth on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">M&amp;A optionality is an important consideration. The company isn\u2019t exactly flush with liquidity but does have the flexibility to be active if they wish. One option they could consider is more financial-oriented (as opposed to strategic) transactions, where the company targets businesses in familiar verticals with any eye toward driving cost and operational synergies, as opposed to expanding revenue growth opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In any case, I really can\u2019t get to an attractive fair value today. Discounted cash flow, even with a \u201cprivileged\u201d discount rate similar to what I use for Dover, Eaton, et al only gets me to a mid-single-digit prospective annualized return. Likewise, if I compare ITW\u2019s forward EBITDA multiple to what would historically be \u201cfair\u201d given ITW\u2019s margins and returns (ROIC, et al), I come up with a roughly 250bp premium. Now, some premium for high quality is fine, but that seems elevated to me.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The worst things I can say about Illinois Tool Works is that the company may lag others in terms of organic growth over the next five to 10 years and the shares seem expensive. That\u2019s not the worst as far as complaints go, and I expect ITW to remain a high-quality multi-industrial name. Still, with weakening end-market trends (including weakening PMI, high inventories, and persistent inflation), I\u2019m not eager to pay such a robust premium when stocks like Dover appear to offer more reasonable upside.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>To read recent articles on
