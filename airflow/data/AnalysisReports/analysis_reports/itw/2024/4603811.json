Dimon has already warned that markets will be gripped by panic as the U.S. approaches a possible default on its sovereign debt. On the same theme, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601633-debt-ceiling-standoff-could-be-worse-for-markets-than-you-think\">Seeking Alpha analyst Logan Kane</a> advised that the standoff could be even worse for markets than anticipated.</p> <p>The economic calendar will include the release of the retail sales report on May 16.

After stripping out the auto and gas categories, retail sales are expected to show a 0.2% gain. Other key reports out during the week include updates on industrial production, business inventories, housing starts, and initial jobless claims.

Of note, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will participate in a bipartisan discussion at the U.S. Capitol on May 15 on the topic of AI and the future. OpenAI's ChatGPT has disrupted thinking on the integration of artificial intelligence into the business world. Following the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI is now one of the fastest growing websites on the planet and is closing in on generating one billion unique visitors per month. However, lawmakers want to tackle some of the security concerns from inside and outside the tech industry. Altman said recently that he thinks Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) could be a \"surprising\" new real player in artificial intelligence after an initial foray into AI that was called confused at best. Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) continue to generate AI buzz. Meanwhile, the question with Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) may be just how much AI monetization should be baked into the share price. In late January, Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) first announced a \"multiyear, multibillion dollar\" investment in OpenAI that has now become part of the investing thesis on the stock. ChatGPT had a dramatic impact on the earnings season for the first time in Q1 with investors looking a little closer at which companies could face an existential threat from AI products and services. Shockingly, online learning firm Chegg (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHGG\" title=\"Chegg, Inc.\">CHGG</a></span>) plunged nearly 50% after management warned that ChatGPT had a negative impact on new customer growth beginning in March due to student interest spiking in the new AI tool. The fear is that ChatGPT may replace many of Chegg's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHGG\" title=\"Chegg, Inc.\">CHGG</a>) services relied on by students. In the week ahead, Chegg (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHGG\" title=\"Chegg, Inc.\">CHGG</a>) execs may update on the company's own AI initiative at an investor conference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Retail heavyweights:</strong> The earnings season will pivot to a major focus on the retail sector next week with Home Depot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD\" title=\"The Home Depot, Inc.\">HD</a>), Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), and Foot Locker (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FL\" title=\"Foot Locker, Inc.\">FL</a>), some of the big names due to step into the earnings confessional. For its part, Morgan Stanley said it is approaching the Q1 retail earnings rush cautiously. \"Durable goods reversion is accelerating, big ticket discretionary purchases are slowing, price gains are moderating and promotions are trickling back in,\" noted analyst Simeon Gutman. While valuations screen as fair for the most part, Gutman advised that investors should continue to hunker down in defensive names like Dollar Tree (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLTR\" title=\"Dollar Tree, Inc.\">DLTR</a>), Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), and BJ's Wholesale Club (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BJ\" title=\"BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc.\">BJ</a>). Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) is forecast to report revenue of $38.4B and EPS of $3.82 for Q1. Analysts think the retail giant could surprise to the upside, yet still hold full-year guidance level in order to keep a cautious stance on the macroeconomic climate. Walmart is beginning to lap some quarters of high labor and transportation costs, which may make it easier to find EPS upside. Home Depot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD\" title=\"The Home Depot, Inc.\">HD</a>) cruises into earnings with analysts expecting revenue of $38.4B and EPS of $3.82 to be reported. The home improvement retailer has a strong track record on earnings day over the last two years, beating EPS estimates in the past eight quarters and revenue estimates in seven of the past eight quarters. The key question for investors may be whether Home Depot will reiterate or lower its full year guide due to macroeconomic factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Corporate events:</strong> Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLAY\" title=\"Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc.\">PLAY</a>) will hold a virtual Investor Day event on May 16. The company has tipped off that its long-term strategies and targets will be discussed. ON Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON\" title=\"ON Semiconductor Corporation\">ON</a>) has a financial analyst meeting set for May 16. Bank of America has circled the ON event as a potential share price catalyst with new long-term revenue growth targets anticipated and the company's role with automated, connected and electrified cars likely to be highlighted. BlackBerry's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BB\" title=\"BlackBerry Limited\">BB</a>) Analyst Day event on May 17, and Illinois Tool Works' (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW\" title=\"Illinois Tool Works Inc.\">ITW</a>) in-person investor conference on May 18 also have the potential to perk up shares. In the healthcare sector, the four-day American Society of Gene + Cell Therapy Meeting could create some ripples. The conference calendar is also loaded next week with notables including the JMP Securities Life Sciences Conference, MoffettNathanson Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference, J.P. Morgan Homebuilding &amp; Building Products Conference, RBC Capital Markets Global Healthcare Conference, Needham Technology &amp; Media Conference, BMO Capital Markets Global Farm to Market Conference, Evercore Battery Metals Conference, and Bank of America Transportation, Airlines, and Industrials Conference.

The increasing frequency of rocket launches and shrinking costs of satellites were said to create early opportunities in space. While launches are the cornerstone for the space industry, areas of growth also include communications applications, Earth observation, satellite services, and construction. In the future, permanent moon installations and commercial space stations could provide even more opportunities for growth. For investors, the space sector has been a rough play to be parked in.
