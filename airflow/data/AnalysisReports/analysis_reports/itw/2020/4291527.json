Not because I own its shares (I don't) or because I have traded the company in the past, but because this company is one of the best stocks to track the economy. The table below shows this quite well. Economic growth bottomed in the first quarter of 2016 in Asia, Europe, and the US. In Q1 of 2018, growth peaked in Asia and Europe while the growth peak in the US happened a few months later in Q4 of 2018. Look how well sales growth did in the months prior to the end of 2018. Every quarter saw solid sales growth - often times above expectations. This abruptly ended in the second half of 2018 and not only resulted in negative sales growth, but in a rising contraction rate.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/12/31557165-15683128723995664_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1023\" data-height=\"391\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/12/31557165-15683128723995664.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"245\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.estimize.com/itw/fq4-2017?metric_name=revenue&amp;chart=table\" rel=\"nofollow\">Estimize</a></em></p> <p>In the second quarter, management hit the nail on the head when <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4278209-illinois-tool-works-inc-itw-ceo-scott-santi-q2-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">mentioning</a> falling demand.</p> <blockquote><p>... we experienced a deceleration in demand across our portfolio.</p></blockquote> <p>Although it's a pretty basic sentence, it perfectly describes what is currently going on as leading economic indicators like the ISM index are currently indicating economic contraction as I discussed in my most recent economic outlook <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289600-u-s-economy-contraction-is\">article</a>.
