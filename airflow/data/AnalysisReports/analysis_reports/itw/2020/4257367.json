In addition to the surprisingly weak revenue number from <strong>3M</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMM\" title=\"3M Company\">MMM</a>) (down 1.1%), <strong>Sandvik</strong>\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDVKY\" title=\"Sandvik AB (publ)\">OTCPK:SDVKY</a>) SMS business saw a 1% decline, and <strong>Stanley Black &amp; Decker</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWK\" title=\"Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\">SWK</a>) saw a 3% decline in its Industrial segment, while all of the discrete automation companies have seen growth slow.</p> <p>Considering all of the above, the 1.5% contraction at <strong>Illinois Tool Works</strong> (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITW\" title=\"Illinois Tool Works Inc.\">ITW</a></span>) this quarter isn\u2019t so shocking or alarming. Perhaps even more important, particularly relative to 3M and Sandvik\u2019s SMS business, is that ITW\u2019s margins held up better \u2013 lending some support to the idea that ITW is a company built more for margins and returns than growth, which isn\u2019t such a bad thing when growth gets scarce.</p> <p>Industrials have rallied since I last wrote about Illinois Tool Works on growing optimism that 2019 growth will be stronger than expected, and ITW has actually outperformed its peer group. Although I don\u2019t have any particular objections to ITW as a hold, I don\u2019t find the valuation exciting enough to start a position here and I still see more risks that growth in North America will slow as 2019 moves on.</p> <h2><strong>Weak Growth And Respectable Margins Make For A Pretty Typical ITW Performance</strong></h2> <p>I don\u2019t want to belabor the idea that ITW is a slow-growing multi-industrial where management has prioritized margins and returns over growth, but that\u2019s what it is and I think that context is important when looking at first-quarter financials. While the growth numbers were pretty unimpressive, I do think the resiliency of margins is an important positive.</p> <p>Overall revenue contracted about 1.5% on an organic basis, but revenue would have been flat if<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> you adjust for a difference in shipping days. Either way, that was still about 2% lower than expected, with auto, food equipment, and welding driving most of the miss. Gross margin held up well (particularly compared to 3M) with a 30 bp improvement, but operating income did fall 7%, missing by about 1%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While adjusting for the sales day difference would add about 1-2% to most of the organic growth rates, I\u2019m going with the non-adjusted figures from here. The Auto segment reported a greater than 6% contraction in sales, with weakness across North America, Europe, and China on lower build rates. Stanley Black &amp; Decker did a little better in its auto fasteners business (down 4%), while 3M and <strong>Rockwell</strong> did noticeably worse in their auto business (though Rockwell is not a great comp for ITW). At the segment level, adjusted margin declined 160 bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Test &amp; Measurement saw a sub-1% contraction, with T&amp;M down 2% (up 5% excluding semiconductors) and electronics up 1%, and it looks like ITW largely kept pace with <strong>Fortive</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTV\" title=\"Fortive Corporation\">FTV</a>) in T&amp;M and surpassed 3M in electronics (again, different product mix). Adjusted segment margin improved 90 bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Food Equipment business saw almost 2% organic revenue growth, with good service demand, and margin improved more than a point. The Polymers business saw about 1% contraction, driven down by a 4% decline in auto, while Fluids and Polymers were up 1% and 2% respectively, modestly underperforming the Advanced Materials businesses at <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>) and 3M. Margin improved by about half a point on an adjusted basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Welding reported nearly 3% growth, with balanced growth in equipment and consumables despite a flattish oil/gas market. That was good for another beat relative to <strong>Lincoln Electric</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LECO\" title=\"Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.\">LECO</a>), which saw 1% revenue growth, and margin was up slightly (30 bps). Construction revenue declined about 1%, with a sharper 4% decline in commercial, and this is a little harder to reconcile relative to Stanley Black &amp; Decker and others, but I\u2019m not surprised to see the slowdown. Margin here improved 20 bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Specialty business saw a nearly 2% decline in revenue and a 30 bp decline in margin. This is a harder business to benchmark (it\u2019s a hodgepodge), but I\u2019d note that <strong>Dover</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>) reported weakness in its can/bottle production business and <strong>Danaher</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DHR\" title=\"Danaher Corporation\">DHR</a>) reported flat results in its packaging business, but Danaher and Dover both saw mid-single-digit growth in product ID and Rockwell said food and beverage automation equipment demand was still generally healthy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What, If Anything, Does ITW Say About The Wider Economy? </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It\u2019s tempting to look at Illinois Tool Works\u2019 results and the sluggish-to-weak results across a range of end-market exposures and say, \u201cSee? It\u2019s not just the auto and electronics sectors that are weak!\u201d And that may yet be true \u2013 the results from companies like ITW, 3M, Sandvik, and other shorter-cycle companies may not just be a \u201cblip\u201d that will correct as the year goes on. On the other hand, as I\u2019ve said before, Illinois Tool Works is a company structured more for margins than growth, so the fact that ITW\u2019s growth numbers are less robust may not say as much as you would think. Even so, the fact that both 3M and ITW reported weakness in the U.S. stands out to me, and I\u2019m still cautious about the outlook for the economy in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For its part, management slightly reduced its organic growth forecast (by 0.5% to 0.5% to 2%), but maintained EPS guidance on healthy segment-level margins. As a reminder, while Illinois Tool Works has already done a lot of cost restructuring in recent years, the company is still looking to dispose of some weaker-performing businesses and eliminating these business could provide a point or so of margin leverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019ve trimmed my revenue growth expectations slightly, but also bolstered my margin assumptions, so the net impact to my fair value estimates is pretty minimal. I value ITW on the assumption of long-term revenue growth in the range of 2%-3% and mid-single-digit FCF growth. While the valuation is not compelling on a discounted cash flow basis, the company\u2019s strong operating margins and very healthy return on assets and invested capital support a mid-teens multiple on EBITDA and the shares are still reasonably-priced on that metric.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019m not inclined to buy Illinois Tool Works here, and I\u2019m still concerned that 2019 growth expectations will need to be revised down again. If and when that happens, and industrials sell off, that would be a good time to go shopping. While the lower structural growth of ITW makes it a harder name to love (at least for some investors), at the right price I would consider it as a good core holding.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW -
