Meaningful exposure to softer end-markets like auto, \u201cgeneral industrial\u201d, non-residential construction, and electronics are headwinds to me, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a lot that ITW management can do to repeat the meaningful past improvements in operating margins. On top of all that, the valuation is not all that cheap at this point.</p> <h2><strong>Another Lackluster Quarter</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a little while now since ITW posted a notably positive quarter, and the company\u2019s sub-1% organic growth for the fourth quarter (and a 1% miss relative to sell-side expectations) doesn\u2019t help. Gross margin was fine (flat in a quarter where peers like <strong>3M</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMM\" title=\"3M Company\">MMM</a>) and <strong>Dover</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>) have struggled to do much better), and segment-level profit squeaked out some growth and beat expectations by 1%, but little-to-no growth on the revenue and segment income lines won\u2019t really get anybody excited.</p> <p>The Auto OEM business saw revenue fall almost 4%, with the North American business up 2% and the EU business down 3%. 3M, Dover, and <strong>Stanley Black &amp; Decker</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWK\" title=\"Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\">SWK</a>) all had better quarters in their auto businesses, which I believe is more to do with customer mix than deeper fundamental underperformance. Margin fell 150bp from the prior year (on a double-digit drop in segment-level profit), and this was definitely the biggest disappointment among ITW\u2019s segments relative to expectations.</p> <p>Test &amp; Measurement was just barely up, missing expectations by about 5%, with actual test &amp; measurement down 1% and electronics up 2%. Margins were notably better, and better than expected, improving 140bp yoy and driving the second-best segment-level profit outperformance.</p> <p>Food Equipment saw better than<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 5% organic growth, with 7% growth in North America and 9% growth in North American equipment sales, driven by double-digit growth from institutional markets like education and lodging. Revenue was a little better than expected, and margins were a lot better than expected (up 70bp), making this a standout next to Dover and I\u2019m curious to see what </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wellbilt</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBT\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WBT</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) and </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Middleby</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MIDD\" title=\"The Middleby Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">MIDD</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) will report.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Polymers and Fluids business saw better than 3% organic growth, helped by strong new product introductions that drove the auto aftermarket business up 7%. Polymers was solid (up 4%), and help offset Fluids (down 4%); this is a tough business to benchmark next to comps like 3M and Honeywell, but it looks like ITW outperformed here and the 170bp improvement in margin was good to see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Welding was up close to 8%, on target with expectations, but certainly slowing (up 10% in the third quarter) ahead of increasingly challenging comps. Growth was balanced between equipment and consumables, but margin improved only 30bp and I\u2019d say that\u2019s disappointing relative to what should be volume leverage, and I\u2019m interested to see what <strong>Lincoln Electric</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LECO\" title=\"Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.\">LECO</a>) and <strong>Colfax</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENOV\">CFX</a>) say vis a vis margins in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Construction was down 1%, 4% below the sell-side expectation, but more in line with my expectation of slowing performance. Sales in North America were down 2%, but margins were stronger than I expected, with a 160bp year-over-year improvement in segment-level operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Specialty revenue was down 2%, missing expectations, with a weaker-than-expected 70bp drop in operating margin.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Challenging End-Markets And Maybe Limited Near-Term Options</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I can\u2019t say that I was surprised when management lowered its revenue growth outlook to 1%-3% for 2019 (from 2%-4%), particularly after seeing 3M put a 1% in for the low end of guidance and <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>) a 2% (Dover\u2019s range was 2% to 4%). ITW has quite a bit of exposure to the auto sector and I\u2019m concerned that the company\u2019s particular OEM/geographic mix will see a down year for build rates in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019m likewise concerned about the prospects for slowing growth in \u201cgeneral industrial\u201d markets and follow-on effects for businesses like welding and polymers/fluids, and slower growth in non-residential construction, with companies like <strong>Ingersoll-Rand</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IR\" title=\"Ingersoll Rand Inc.\">IR</a>) and Honeywell acknowledging some slowdowns in the market. On the flip side, Illinois Tool Works doesn\u2019t have much leverage to areas like aerospace, agriculture, mining, healthcare, or process automation that are likely to be stronger in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am also not so confident that Illinois Tool Works can do all that much on the margin side to offset the immediate revenue growth pressures. True, the company did outperform on margins this quarter, but the company is exiting a multiyear program that accomplished quite a lot and I just can\u2019t see a lot of fruit left on the tree to pluck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Portfolio optimization could be a source of upside. At the December investor day management mentioned seven business units with long-term growth issues and a willingness to consider sales. There isn\u2019t enough information to really calculate the impact these sales would have on margins, but it seems reasonable to assume it would at least boost the top-line growth rate and give management some additional fuel for buybacks. In terms of growing the business through M&amp;A, it doesn\u2019t sound like management has any major plans here at this point, and it\u2019s well worth noting that ITW has never been big on large-scale M&amp;A.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although I think ITW management has done a lot to optimize margins already, I do expect some incremental cost reduction opportunities over time (more automation, etc.). That should help push an underlying organic revenue growth rate of around 3% toward a 4% long-term FCF growth rate. Management does have the liquidity and flexibility to do more through M&amp;A to enhance long-term growth, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot \u2013 Illinois Tool Works has long been a \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d sort of company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation is a little muddled. The shares don\u2019t look cheap at all on a discounted cash flow basis, but they do look noticeably undervalued (10%-plus) on a margin/ROIC/ROA-driven EV/EBITDA approach. I attribute the difference to the lower growth profile, both historically and prospectively, as ITW has never been known for its robust growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you think that key end-markets like autos, manufacturing/general industrial, and non-residential construction will exceed expectations in 2019, ITW would be a name to consider as growth expectations seem to be quite low at this point (at management\u2019s direction, I\u2019d note). I don\u2019t find the total risk-adjusted return to be all that exciting now, but similar to my feelings on 3M, I think it\u2019s a decent enough hold for the time being, particularly given the well above-average quality element.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Weak Growth And Robust Expectations Create Headwinds For Illinois Tool Works.
