Otherwise, we\u2019re talking about an incredibly well-run conglomerate that is very diversified across the globe (albeit a little light toward China) and across end-markets (albeit a little heavy toward auto). Management\u2019s 80/20 system has generated proven results for years and very very few companies can produce these kinds of margins and returns on a sustained basis.</p> <p>I thought ITW had some \u201cbest of the rest\u201d attributes <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4257367-illinois-tool-works-margins-seem-to-be-holding-up-well-growth-slows\">back in April</a>, largely on the strength of its margins, but the shares have done quite a bit better than its peer group since then \u2013 climbing more than 15%, handily surpassing the performance of the industrial sector as well as many other well-regarded (or formerly well-regarded) multi-industrials like <strong>Eaton</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETN\" title=\"Eaton Corporation plc\">ETN</a>), <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>), <strong>3M</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMM\" title=\"3M Company\">MMM</a>), <strong>Parker-Hannifin</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PH\" title=\"Parker-Hannifin Corporation\">PH</a>). <strong>Dover</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOV\" title=\"Dover Corporation\">DOV</a>) and <strong>Danaher</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DHR\" title=\"Danaher Corporation\">DHR</a>) are among the few to beat ITW\u2019s performance over that period, though Danaher really isn\u2019t a true peer anymore.</p> <p>At this point, I can\u2019t really sign off on the valuation Illinois Tool Works is getting. Sure, I understand that investors are taking positions ahead of an expected 2020 rebound, and I also get that high-margin stocks get high multiples. I also understand that once the Street picks a favorite/safe haven, they\u2019ll run it to unsustainable valuations (as happened with 3M). So, while I could maybe stretch my valuation methodology far enough to say it\u2019s not hugely overpriced, a mid-single-digit prospective return is just too low for me.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s Cyclical, It\u2019s Defensive, It\u2019s An Overachiever \u2026 All Of That Is True</strong></h2> <p>Illinois Tool Works is a weird hodgepodge of several traits and types. Its strong margins and market shares do<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> give it some defensive attributes \u2013 ITW usually doesn\u2019t get hit as hard when the economy slows, and quarterly organic revenue contraction may well bottom out at around 3%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But it also has cyclical attributes as well; the auto and welding business have gotten smacked pretty hard, and test &amp; measurement somewhat as well, and there may be a day of reckoning down the road for construction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Above all, though, it has a lot of traits of just simple operating excellence. Not too many multi-industrials have 40%-plus gross margins (not even the great and much-loved Honeywell), and ITW is likewise very strong on efficient SG&amp;A spending, giving it a very strong margin and ROIC/ROA profile. Where it doesn\u2019t overachieve is on core growth \u2013 the best quarterly core revenue growth number over the past five years was still below 4% and it hasn\u2019t exceeded 5% since 2011.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Time To Tweak The Model?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That leads me to one issue or question to ponder \u2013 how much better can Illinois Tool Works be just doing what it has been doing? Management\u2019s decision to pause M&amp;A activity, retrench, and make sure every business was as optimized to the 80/20 approach as possible has clearly produced results, but how much is left in the tank? And can investors reasonably expect better than 2% to 3% growth in the best of times?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I know ITW management doesn\u2019t like questions about the R&amp;D spend, but the reality is that they do spend less than almost any peer I can find (far less than <strong>Fortive</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTV\" title=\"Fortive Corporation\">FTV</a>), 3M, Eaton, <strong>Emerson</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR\" title=\"Emerson Electric Co.\">EMR</a>), and so on). 3M and Honeywell have both argued in the past that their R&amp;D programs are essential aspects to their models and part of why they can generate above-peer growth and margins (though 3M is going through a rough patch now). Perhaps, if ITW turned the dial a bit on R&amp;D, they could generate more growth without compromising long-term margins all that much, with higher gross margins and volume-driven operating leverage recouping the incremental spending.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Waiting For The Turns</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works generates about 25% of its revenue from the auto end-market (about 17% or 18% from OEM, the rest from aftermarket), and that\u2019s a tough place to be now, though true to form, ITW is outgrowing the underlying volumes of the industry on share/content gains. The company is also suffering some for its exposure to a range of heavy machinery and general industry markets, primarily through its welding business and some in the test &amp; measurement and fluids businesses. Exposure to semiconductors and electronics through test &amp; measurement has also weighed on results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking at 2020, I believe many short-cycle industrial markets will start returning to some growth in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s good for around 25% to 30% of ITW\u2019s revenue, though I think markets like heavy machinery and oil/gas will likely be weaker in 2020 than they were in 2019. Autos is a harder call \u2013 I think it will be \u201cless bad\u201d (lower volume declines), but I won\u2019t underestimate ITW\u2019s ability to grow above underlying production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the more positive side, non-residential construction will likely slow, but stay positive, food equipment will keep chugging along, and food/bev, MRO, and electronics should improve. All told, it\u2019ll probably a no-growth year for ITW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Organic growth prospects may be dim, but management has indicated they\u2019re ready to get back to work on M&amp;A. While management has said they could do a deal for up to $1 billion to $3 billion in annual revenue (basically adding another segment), they\u2019re more likely to add a couple of smaller companies in the $100M to $150M revenue range and drop them into \u201cSpecialty\u201d before figuring out their longer term strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The way management has been talking about this, I think they want to buy or build a new segment, but what might they target? Automation is a possibility given the long-term growth potential, and some areas of automation (controls, sensors, flow control components) can support 20%-plus segment margins (which I believe is a must-have). Software has the margins and good growth, as does aerospace, but acquisition multiples would likely be prohibitively high. HVAC and building controls/systems would be another possibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019m still expecting long-term core growth form Illinois Tool Works in the 2% to 3% range, and I\u2019m likewise still expecting FCF margins to grind higher into the low 20%\u2019s over time, supporting mid-single-digit FCF growth. I think operating margins can get to around 26% over the next three to five years, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much upside beyond that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Discounting the cash flows back, the prospective return looks frankly pretty poor. My margin and return-driven EV/EBITDA is a little more forgiving, but about the best I can do is a 16x forward multiple that would support a fair value in the high $170s, but that\u2019s really the modeling equivalent of redlining an engine.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you own Illinois Tool Works, maybe think about some trailing stops to protect your returns (particularly in tax-free/tax-deferred accounts). If you don\u2019t own it, I\u2019d advise being patient. While ITW\u2019s status as a darling could certainly last a while longer, the readjustment process is usually pretty bumpy, and I think there are other options in the sector that don\u2019t require you to sacrifice much quality for better valuation.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works Is A Margin Beast, But The Valuation Is A Little Scary.
