Thus on a risk-adjusted (returns/volatility) basis, they have beaten the market by an impressive 52% per year. The secret to this outperformance is that aristocrats generally match the market during good times, but fall far less during recessions and bear markets. That's courtesy of their long-term and income focused investor bases, who are less likely to panic sell during a downturn.</p> <p>But the popularity of aristocrats, combined with a bull market that's now in its 10th year (second longest in history), means that all the aristocrats are trading at rich valuations, right?

Smith are likely to deliver excellent total returns over the coming years. In fact, from their current valuations, I expect ITW and AOS to generate about 15% and 18.5% annualized total returns over the coming decade. That means these are two of the best dividend aristocrats you can buy today.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works: A Fast Growing Dividend King</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Founded in 1912, Illinois Tool Works is one of the world's largest industrial conglomerates, with over 500 manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities in 57 countries. While it's highly diversified by geography, the largest market by far remains the US.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>US: 44% of 2017 sales</li> <li>North America: 51% of sales</li> <li>Europe/Middle East/Africa: 29% of sales</li> <li>Asia Pacific: 18% of sales</li> <li>Latin America: 3% of sales</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's 85 subsidiaries make thousands of mission critical parts for dozens of industries:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>plastic and metal components, fasteners, and assemblies for automotive industry</li> <li>commercial food equipment</li> <li>beverage packaging equipment, product coding &amp; marking equipment</li> <li>equipment for machine testing and measurement of materials and structures including for electronic subassemblies and microelectronics</li> <li>welding equipment</li> <li>construction fastening systems and trusses</li> <li>adhesives, sealants, lubrication, fluids, and polymers for auto aftermarket industry</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The industrial component sector is highly fragmented. Companies like ITW maintain their wide moats courtesy of long standing relationships with customers, some that span decades. Most of its industrial products are actually customized for each individual clients, to meet their specific reliability, durability, and safety requirements. This means ITW enjoys high switching costs and a wide moat, in which it can raise prices on customers without significant risk of losing market share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The downside to wide moats is that it means the company has to grow through acquisitions, which are very common for industrial conglomerates. In the last 25 years, ITW has made about 600 bolt-on acquisitions to acquire new clients and markets. Over time that can make company wide integration challenging which is where ITW's biggest competitive advantage comes in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The key to what makes ITW such a great long-term investment is its \"enterprise strategy\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_kOck3s5hK3nFBR6BXHvPUqwTzMxZU2rEBa8sBT6oEAwiK7El4HxE3czkQyXiwhDVVqyZNnUsLI7oT7ClL44Ie2nUEIT7B7ovrOBhyZi885gqoZtc5JIF2ErhEvXp-5PVm4xjY4Xx.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"277\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"285\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source:<a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/Cache/1001241798.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001241798&amp;iid=4992234\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Illinois Tool Works investor presentation</a>)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Launched in 2013 ITW has invested over $3 billion into optimizing its current business model by continuing and improving the 80/20 capital allocations strategy launched in 1985. 80/20 means focusing most of its resources on the 20% of customers and product lines that generate 80% of revenue and profits. Since 2013 ITW has sold off its 30 weakest performing business units to recycle that capital to target industries that are growing faster than the global economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, ITW has added deep customer feedback to its business model, so it can better utilize its approximate 1.7% of revenue R&amp;D budget to continue improving the products it offers customers. That lean R&amp;D budget still translates into 17,000 current and pending patents, and about 1,600 new ones per year. This helps to further increase the company's wide moat, pricing power and profitability (more on this in a moment).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Most importantly, ITW has proven itself a master of decentralized management and streamlining. For example, in 2012 it had 800 subsidiaries, courtesy of those 600 previous acquisitions. Today the company has cut its product lines by 80%, and has just 85 operating units. Those units are run in a Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>) style fashion, in which managers have clearly defined sales, profitability and returns on invested capital targets. The corporate office doesn't micromanage its subsidiaries but allows local management to achieve those goals in any way they see fit. This means that despite being one of the largest industrial conglomerates in the world, ITW operates like a very lean and adaptable startup (relative to its peers).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall the company's goal is to focus on the most profitable and fastest growing markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_pCNhLJ5M7V5Vb4IgZ3k_XpphE_EnJxSaAAdu44fwb1t6D5AkULPpOy8uFL_6Ep8e9Kcs12JRy7ApCEU5SGHvuT2k3WGorIvPFZiC0qA56OhbhkKc_4YfYh36HYBfaKIU-VY6ykpl.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"269\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_BiWT8KCMr782s-dOafJ-0pa9tUXrVcLsaEVNGlt4RVi4io801yps7Fle4z1RBrPkWm-SAHpQrs6sJ7ZR7yj5Y3H4JsGuNjOJDgFkrGNtXXQg2edqPg3QQbGQwNPd5q8PGzxSifdZ.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"305\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: ITW investor presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Combined with a laser like focus on cost cutting (investing in highly automated and just in time production), this has allowed the company's segment margins to increase by between 1.6% and 12.2% over the past five years. In fact, at the end of 2017 Illinois Tools' operating margins were all significantly better than their industry peers. At the company wide level that increased profitability has meant some of the industry's best margin and EPS growth over the past half decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_OFXAKXPB9HYtLEE4qCyqb7446zW9bofkkYkvFNzv6qv1QcrOsB2YfkKbMbRsWwOf_qEV_jCNW_N-vc_dVvG-D1LlxTSPzsx6mlFUtwQX-OpLUg_8la5cWxM_6zpQ58FwEHYjEEQy.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"253\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: ITW investor presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And thanks to a very shareholder corporate culture, that means income investors have enjoyed spectacular dividend growth over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_1VR5fuEDVVcmPoEpd7ARW4Utkt6P_IPXxkf7MgSnEuZBIaMs_JYvCk6dRIAPwFxW4SHwlsIULxdw06WBNUAeeZBWUK4MVxY4CWmm3ww-WfsFlAgsTTmbUkjijqXrMCzHCVbMf2ai.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"327\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: Illinois Tool Works investor presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thanks to strong sales growth in key business segments, especially those related to construction, ITW has been able to deliver very strong top and bottom line results in the first half of 2018. This kind of growth is hardly what one would expect from a stock that's in a strong bear market.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Metric</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>First Half 2018 Growth</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>7.1%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>17.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Free Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>24.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Shares Outstanding</p></td> <td><p>-2.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EPS</p></td> <td><p>19.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>FCF</p></td> <td><p>27.0%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dividend</p></td> <td><p>10.3%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: earnings release)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The most important thing for income investors to focus on is free cash flow or FCF. That's what's left over after running the business and investing in future growth. FCF is what ultimately pays the dividend. Thanks to large economies of scale and tax reform, ITW's FCF/share has exploded in 2018, which largely explains why it just<a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/file/Index?KeyFile=394508161\" rel=\"nofollow\"> raised its dividend by 28%</a> for 2018, the 54th consecutive year of annual increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For 2018 management is now guiding for 15% EPS growth, which is slightly slower than the first half of the year. However, that still puts the company on track to achieve management's long-term goals of about 9% EPS and FCF/share growth. In fact, analysts are currently forecasting that ITW's earnings and cash flow will grow at 9.8% (top end of guidance) for the next 10 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_tgS_ZoGu1fn7NhUjdPk9YdCJLaMN9r0KqYBNr8Yeuiqw-gFonv5AoJW2ZttVCyCUO1To10d5Ncm3RuS1_ZIzKqAJ7riD0VDN7esZl9qgG_iF-9gLd6_7bZS53OkM7bgVcPAm3BxS.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"100\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"102\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source:<a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Illinois Tool Works</a>)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And with management targeting a safe 50% FCF payout ratio (and 100+% earnings to FCF conversion rate), that means the dividend is likely to also grow at 8% to 10% over the long-term. That's not as fast as the company's most recent dividend increases, which have ranged from 11% to 28%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, as I'll soon show, it's still good enough to make Illinois Tool Works one of the best dividend kings you can own, especially at today's attractive prices. But if Illinois Tool Works is such a great company, and seeing strong growth top and bottom line growth, why does Wall Street hate the stock right now? That comes down to the company's risk profile.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks To Consider</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With 56% of sales coming from outside the US, ITW has significant currency risk in the short to medium-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_UXsKER5CQR0Y3e6H32LPSNpgr9P_ByenHcowCvAzX4JhbPAU7fjS_tTZPwWdNnwTtkAb41iTwveCvd1pOnd4yqE__ZJmwvxI1EwwE56iZ97l1V8atVx_SMpbzne8XrJM4-UVKuWi.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"192\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"197\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source:<a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/Cache/1500112108.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500112108&amp;iid=4992234\" rel=\"nofollow\"> earnings release</a>)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In Q2 2018, the company actually benefitted from the dollar weakening relative to local currenices, which significantly boosted its organic growth. However, due to the US economy outperforming most other economies right now, and rising US interest rates, more foreign capital could flow into US assets (like higher-yielding Treasury bonds). That might cause the dollar to strengthen, which would mean temporary growth headwinds. In fact, according to CEO Scott Santi the company now expects negative currency headwinds for the back half of the year (<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/24/analysts-duel-over-how-to-react-to-illinois-tool-w.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">$0.12 per share</a> in reduced EPS guidance for 2018).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While currency fluctuations tend to cancel out over the long-term, Wall Street's obsession with short-term results means that ITW might miss its guidance and see continued share weakness in the next few quarters (or even a year or two).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The other major concern the market has is trade wars and tariffs disrupting its global supply chain, raising input costs, and potentially costing it market share in its fast growing Asian markets (especially China). Should the US and China fail to strike a trade deal soon, then 25% tariffs on all Chinese imports (and Chinese retaliation) could weigh on the company's growth next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_SehtWICQeaYyZxDl8y2-s2uckU86ePmFDuNQyadzdUJiVA1ZyLcfuzymyDKZo-AKhj6XWj0bgksGluvKCcePAMQq1Tqmdb4a8F7OOyPytLJC-ckOYRda2v39ZTT6g3VVOVCo57hO.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"288\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"295\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source:<a href=\"https://investor.itw.com/Cache/1001239973.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001239973&amp;iid=4992234\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ITW earnings presentation</a>)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While in the short term, tariffs increase the company's raw material costs just 3%, that combined with rising commodity prices in the US have caused management to lower its 2018 operating margin guidance from<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/28/are-these-2-dividend-aristocrat-stocks-to-buy-toda.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 25.3% to 24.5%</a>.

Smith's competitive advantage in product design and innovation can be seen in its over 50% market share in commercial heaters, such as those used in hospitals, schools, hotels, and other large commercial buildings.

Smith Investor Presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The crown jewel in <span>A.O. Smith's business is currently China, where the company has delivered 21% annualized sales growth over the past decade. This has been thanks to that country's massive increase in its middle class, who is eager for top quality water heaters but also air and water purifiers. By 2020 China's middle class is expected to reach 600 million, or nearly double the population of the entire US. Management estimates that this will translate into about 200 million households who can afford its products. Best of all, <span>A.O. Smith is extremely well positioned to benefit from the strong demand in its products by this army of consumers.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That's thanks to being an early mover in China, setting up its first officers there more than 15 years ago. Today <span>A.O. Smith sells its water heaters and purifiers via over 9,000 distributors in China, and has a presence in 30% of China's largest cities. Its presence in medium sized cities is 70%, showing that it still has a long growth runway in that country, in terms of expanding its market presence.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_vkao5008Ia8xNX0zdi0hGD5fZVu_I_kq3tDFN6MACqUNjxC6HVnGARQKxzTgzakkQh99uQ3NtQADX7z_8rkwSDXX5lrynASb_dOCiqbxZ9EL17xlrwS4HuJUeww7y520u26WlM8Z.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"289\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: A.O. Smith Investor Presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But in addition to selling more water heaters and boilers in China, <span>A.O. Smith could make a fortune in air purifiers. Thanks to China's legendarily terrible air quality China's air purifiers sales have been skyrocketing. For example, in 2012 sales per 1000 households were just 7. By 2020 they are expected to increase 400% to 35. And even that huge increase in sales translates to just 21% market saturation in China's 23 largest and most polluted cities.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But while <span>A.O. Smith's China opportunity alone would make it a standout dividend aristocrat worth buying, it's the Indian business that makes <span>A.O. Smith a true \"must own\" dividend growth stock.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>A.O. Smith was the first US company in its industry to enter the Indian market:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>First office in India: 2008</li> <li>Begins making and selling water heaters in India: 2010</li> <li>Begins making and selling water/air purifiers: 2015</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In 2017 Indian sales grew 44% to $26 million, or about 1% of total company sales. Now granted the company booked a $7.5 million operating loss on those sales. But continued strong growth in India means that losses in 2018 are expected to be $5 million, or 33% smaller.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">India's middle class (who can afford <span>A.O. Smith products) is estimated to reach 273 million households in 2020 and 322 million in 2030. That's why between 2020 and 2030 <span>A.O. Smith is planning to more than double the number of product segments in India. In fact, India is ultimately a far better growth market for AOS than China.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That's because of superior demographics, meaning a much younger and still fast growing population. The UN estimates that by 2024 India will surpass China as the world's most populated country. By 2030 India's population is expected to hit 1.5 billion, and by 2050, peak at <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-population-to-surpass-that-of-chinas-around-2024-un/articleshow/59257232.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.7 billion</a>. After 2060 it's expected to gradually decline as a maturing economy leads to lower fertility rates. The point is that India is a huge untapped market, and one that's only going to get bigger for the next 50 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>A.O.

In fact, the company's sales in Q2 increased 13%, which translated into 25% EPS growth (14% growth excluding tax cuts).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Similarly, in the first half of the year, AOS similarly has delivered excellent results, despite what the stock price might have you believe.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Metric</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>First Half 2018 Growth</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>9.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>18.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Free Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>262%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Shares Outstanding</p></td> <td><p>-1.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EPS</p></td> <td><p>19.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>FCF</p></td> <td><p>263%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dividend</p></td> <td><p>28.6%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: earnings release, Morningstar)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Note that due to its small size and the lumpiness of capex investments <span>A.O. Smith's FCF can be volatile from quarter to quarter. On a comparative trailing 12 month basis FCF grew a healthy 15%, in line with its earnings growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And for 2018 management expects operating cash flow to rise 46% and free cash flow to grow an astounding<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4190105-o-smith-aos-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\"> 61%</a>. This, combined with a low payout ratio (33% over the past 12 months), is what allowed AOS to reward investors with a just announced <a href=\"https://investor.aosmith.com/news-releases/news-release-details/o-smith-announces-22-percent-dividend-increase-22-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">22% dividend hike</a>. That's the second of the year, following a 29% increase in January. Investors should probably assume this 22% increase represents next year's hike, but the large magnitude is still among the best of any aristocrat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So if <span>A.O. Smith is growing quickly, and has such massive growth potential in China and India, why is the share price near 52 week lows? Again that comes down to the risk profile.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks To Consider</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The biggest reason Wall Street is currently so bearish on AOS is due to its heavy exposure to China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With US steel tariffs increasing its primary input cost, and China's economy potentially set to slow in 2019 from the trade war, investors fear that <span>A.O. Smith's margins will come under pressure and its red hot foreign market sales will cool off. The good news is that the company recently increased its wholesale boiler prices 10% in the US to offset higher steel costs. Thus far this hasn't resulted in a loss of sales volumes due to the strong economy fueling construction demand and generating a strong boiler replacement cycle. In fact, management is guiding for about 10% revenue growth in the US in 2018, which is far above its long-term guidance for North America. What about China? Well, there the news isn't so rosy.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">JPMorgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) is now saying that 25% US tariffs on all Chinese imports are its<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-china-tariffs-jpmorgan-forecasts-2018-10\" rel=\"nofollow\"> base case scenario for 2019</a>. And Wall Street isn't just worried that retaliatory tariffs from Bejing might cost AOS market share in the middle kingdom. There are very real concerns that a trade war, if it persists, might slow China's growth rate, and thus its demand for things like water heaters, and air and water purifiers. For example, JPMorgan estimates that a full blown trade war with the US will knock 1% off China's growth in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Already there are signs that the trade war is dragging on China's already slowing economy (their workforce has been shrinking since 2014). For example, China's government recently announced it would start a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/business/china-lending-trade-war.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $175 billion stimulus program</a> to boost falling growth rates. Most of that will come from lowering capital requirements for banks, so they can lend more money. It's important to note that China's $12 trillion economy isn't nearly as reliant on US exports (just over $500 billion per year) as it once was. However, in recent years wage growth, consumer spending, and infrastructure investment have all started to pull back, which means that any tariff induced slowdown will merely make already slowing growth worse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What does that mean for <span>A.O. Smith? Well, while China sales grew 12% in Q2, 2/3 of that was due to positive currency translation, specifically from the Yuan depreciating against the dollar. In local currency sales grew just 4%, but management expects that to increase to 6% in the second half of the year (5% full year). Now it's true this is a much slower growth rate than what Wall Street is used to. However, we have to remember that <span>A.O. Smith, like all aristocrats, is focused on the long-term. And at the most recent conference call management said it remains confident in its long-term growth guidance, including 14% long-term annual sales growth from its China and Indian businesses. In 2019 strong Indian sales are expected to help support any weakness in China. But management is confident that organic growth in China over the long-term will still run about<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/03/is-this-once-hot-growth-company-cooling-off.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 12% to 13%</a>, even as China's economy matures and growth rates slow. And in the medium-term 15% growth in China is what management expects.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, just because the China/India growth leg of the AOS investment thesis remains intact, doesn't mean that investors don't face another risk to be aware of. That would be currency risk. China and India have more volatile currencies which might cause stronger swings in the companies future sales and cash flow growth. For example, thanks to the trade war causing about 10% devaluation of the Yuan this year (relative to the dollar), AOS is actually forecasting a $33 million positive currency translation boost in 2018. That's about 50% higher than it expected back in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But like with Illinois Tool Works, it's important to remember that currencies tend to be mean reverting. The strong growth tailwinds of 2018 caused by a falling Yuan will eventually reverse and become headwinds. And with China and India expected to be the best growth drivers going forward <span>A.O. Smith's earnings will likely become more volatile over time. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Combined with the cyclical nature of its business, this explains why AOS is usually about 37% more volatile than the S&amp;P 500. Of course for long-term income investors mostly concerned with safe and growing dividends, volatility can be a blessing. That's because it allows you to buy fast growing dividend aristocrats like these at bargain basement prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_VHjdJiL8x4HZb87GWmI7zSTOBK24j6U6vTU0MTjHqVRh7XTKrSqvSrUc_A2EBQu4_yGzxBu-_qfnodUw4VacFXif3qEBaX4DRaNNgoV9K_3x-MX24dbN_fhnaEi62TNPpqqgP0x6.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"624\" height=\"360\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/ITW/total_return_price\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITW Total Return Price</a> data by<a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"> YCharts</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So while both ITW and AOS may face relatively wild swings in prices in the coming years, investors should remain confident that bear markets for these stocks are a great time to buy. That's because both have the world class management teams with proven track records of generating market smashing returns.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quality Management Makes All The Difference</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Ultimately quality management is what generates long-term investor returns. Running a global industrial conglomerate is a challenging process that requires constantly adapting to changing industry conditions. A quality, long-term focused management team is essential to allocating investor capital wisely over time, and delivering the kind of fast cash flow and dividend growth that income investors crave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tool Works has a \"promote from within\" culture led by Chairman and CEO Scott Santi. Santi took over for the last CEO, David Speer, who died of an illness in 2012. Santi has been with ITW since 1983 and has spent his entire career steeped in the company's efficient operating culture. Over his 35 year tenure with Illinois Tool, Mr. Santi has worn many hats, including overseeing the running of five of its eight (at the time) business segments. The bottom line is that Illinois Tools is led by a master capital allocator, who has been able to centralize the company's logistics chain, which boosted operating margins by 3% all on its own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>A.O. Smith also has a great corporate culture, marked by very low turnover at the top. For example, in its 144 year history, AOS has had just nine CEOs, meaning an average CEO tenure of 16 years. Today <span>A.O. Smith is led by CEO Ajita Rajendra, who has over 40 years of industry experience, and has been in the top spot since 2014. He's been with the company since 2005, when he started as President of the water products business. That business has been instrumental to achieving AOS' fast growth over the years, especially in China and India.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A good proxy for quality management is comparing a company's profits and returns on invested capital to its peers.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Gross Margin</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Operating Margin</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net Margin</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>FCF Margin</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Return On Invested Capital</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Illinois Tool Works</p></td> <td><p>41.8%</p></td> <td><p>24.3%</p></td> <td><p>17.4%</p></td> <td><p>15.5%</p></td> <td><p>30%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><span>A.O.

Both ITW and AOS have strong FCF margins, with ITW's being larger thanks to larger economies of scale (costs spread out over 5X larger sales). But both companies sport net margins that are many times greater than the industry average, as well as eye-popping ROIC. ROIC is a proxy for capital allocation over time, including acquisitions, capex, and R&amp;D spending that are essential to running a good industrial company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One example of superior capital allocation efficiency is the fact that ITW spends just 4.2% of sales on R&amp;D and capex (growing capacity and cutting costs). That's compared to about 10% for most of its larger rivals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_C4_vH9gc01ReyhIXasyBij_BsyhaRu23kNGJEpTMFHIJZMc2kQdAy5fMefd-vRzgi30n31s2EPh6JOcr5pJpK0bCbF1OOwpk68QObXwj6n2Wd1l2U-4OqgmwdB7ND5HQtf6CsGT-.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"263\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"270\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: Illinois Tool Works investor presentation)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Most of the company's operating cash flow is dedicated to the fast growing dividend, which I love to see. But just as importantly an equal amount is set aside for growing the business through smart strategic bolt-on acquisitions. This means purchasing companies in fast growing and profitable industries, that ITW can easily integrate into its corporate culture and global marketing and supply chain. The company also invests heavily, but wisely, into targeted organic growth, with an eye towards achieving above industry average organic growth rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>A.O. Smith's capital allocation discipline can be seen by management forgoing large, and debt fueled acquisitions. For example, most of its M&amp;A is bolt-on acquisitions such as 2017's Aquasana ($87 million) and Hague ($45 million). These are small water treatment companies that will help grow that business in North America. Those purchases are mostly cash based, because management wants to maintain maximum financial flexibility and a fortress like balance sheet (more on this in a moment).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Basically, <span>A.O. Smith is mostly focused on organic growth, primarily capitalizing on growth opportunities in China and India. Steady but disciplined investment in R&amp;D and capex (cost cutting and efficiency gains), combined with fast growth in sales means steadily higher margins. Which in turn will translate into excellent growth in FCF and the dividend.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Which brings me to the biggest reason to buy these fast growing blue chips today, some of the best dividend profiles of any dividend aristocrat.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend Profile: Safe And Fast Growing Dividends And Market Beating Return Potential</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The most important part of any income investment is the dividend profile. This consists of three parts: yield, payout safety, and long-term growth potential. Combined with valuation, this has historically been what drives total returns.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>TTM FCF Payout Ratio</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Expected Long-Term Dividend Growth</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Expected CAGR Total Return (From Fair Value)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Valuation Adjusted CAGR Total Return Potential</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Illinois Tool Works</p></td> <td><p>3.0%</p></td> <td><p>45%</p></td> <td><p>8% to 10%</p></td> <td><p>11% to 13%</p></td> <td><p>14.4% to 15.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><span>A.O.

Sure Illinois Tool's yield is 50% above that of the S&amp;P 500, but AOS' is in line with the broader market. However, what they lack in current yield these aristocrats more than make up for in safety and strong growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With payout ratios of under 50% (considered safe for this industry), both stocks have strong dividend safety buffers that protect and keep the dividend rising even during recessions. Just as important as the payout ratio is the balance sheet. Too much debt can threaten the safety of the dividend, even if free cash flow easily covers this annual cost.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Debt/EBITDA</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>S&amp;P Credit Rating</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Average Interest Cost</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Illinois Tool Works</p></td> <td><p>1.8</p></td> <td><p>16.0</p></td> <td><p>A+</p></td> <td><p>3.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><span>A.O.

Smith have fortress like balance sheets. That includes below average leverage ratios and strong interest coverage ratios. That's why ITW has a very strong investment grade credit rating that allows it to borrow at rates eight times lower than its ROIC. <span>A.O. Smith chooses not to pay the $200 to $500K per year to have a credit rating but if it wanted to it would likely also be rated \"A\" given its very modest debt levels. In fact, <span>A.O. Smith has a net cash position of $410 million and is generating $219 million in annual retained FCF to grow that over time. That's why it's interest costs are also far below its ROIC. </span></span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As for long-term dividend growth potential, ITW's payout is likely to rise as fast as EPS and FCF/share. That's due to its payout ratio being close to management's long-term target of 50%. <span>A.O. Smith has room to raise the payout ratio but might want to retain more cash to fund its ambitious growth plans in China and India. Basically, I'm assuming that both companies will only grow the dividends as fast as their FCF/share. Fortunately, that's likely to be close to 10% for ITW and about 11.5% for AOS. Combining those growth rates with the current yields we get an estimated long-term return potential of 12% and 13.3%, respectively. That assumes no multiple expansion in the future. For context, the S&amp;P 500's historical (since 1871) return has been<a href=\"https://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 9.2%</a>. So even if the market remains this bearish on both stocks forever, both should still deliver market beating returns.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, in reality, dividend aristocrat valuations never stay permanently depressed so when we adjust for valuation mean reversion, we actually find that ITW and AOS are likely to generate about 15% and 18.5% long-term CAGR total returns, respectively. In contrast Morningstar, BlackRock and Vanguard expect the S&amp;P 500 to deliver between 0% and 5% CAGR total returns over the coming five to 10 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Why do I expect both Illinois Tool and <span>A.O. Smith to see such strong valuation returns boosts? Because both are trading at such large discounts to fair value.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation: Best Time In Nearly A Decade To Buy These Aristocrats</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_8zot-TdibL6fZsAUdzsAwgr7cYRcd0x-qU-IbVWf54LCA8AjDo604Mw0ko1AdTAa3FsEYyUROZIJFNbR7XoW4r8yJJU2pudEZC3STedcQ7FReJoT9SChB9bshZKnmueUsR1T7XIe.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"624\" height=\"360\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/ITW/total_return_price\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITW Total Return Price</a> data by<a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"> YCharts</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Both ITW and AOS have delivered terrible total returns over the past year.

What's more, at today's PE ratios, both stocks are pricing in about 4% to 5% long-term EPS growth, far below what management or analysts think is likely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Ok, so both Illinois Tool Works and <span>A.O. Smith are like undervalued. But by how much and what does that mean for future long-term total returns? To answer that I turn to a time tested dividend valuation method called Dividend Yield Theory or DYT. Since 1966, asset manager and newsletter publisher Investment Quality Trends has been using this valuation approach exclusively. The result has been decades of market crushing returns, with about 10% less volatility to boot.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/17/saupload_jQUEbTPcceLiNkM3Rq0m66XOif28ZA-qZhXQOKSUhMswcel7rxsebgd2CAX6RVvEZkaViaC-PVy1d3p66qLk9nFRemaeViH-N8ayy2uhT7_UeJHMTNbVdGvzAV2lTpokwb8ipAtt.jpeg\" width=\"624\" height=\"280\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"287\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><em>(Source: Investment Quality Trends)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">DYT merely compares a dividend stocks' yield to its historical yield. As long as the business model is stable (doesn't change over time) then yields are usually mean reverting. That means they cycle around a historical point that approximates fair value. Purchase a stock when the yield is significantly above its historical fair value yield and you buy it at a high margin of safety. When the yield returns to its historical norm the share price will rise faster than cash flow and dividends, thus boosting your returns.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>5 Year Average Yield</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>13 Year Median Yield</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Historical Yield Range</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Illinois Tool Works</p></td> <td><p>3.0%</p></td> <td><p>2.1%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>1.6% to 4.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><span>A.O.

Smith enjoys the benefit of two massive dividend hikes this year, which the market will eventually reward it for.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I can't predict how quickly both yields will return to historical levels, but it's almost certain to happen over the next five to 10 years. I model 10 year time horizons, but even that long span would equate to 3.4% and 5.1% annual return boosts for ITW and AOS, respectively. Combine that with the Gordon Dividend Growth Model (yield + long-term dividend growth = total returns), which has been accurate since 1956, and that's how you can estimate long-term total returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The bottom line is that for this caliber of company (fast growing dividend aristocrats) investors will do well buying at fair value or better. So when blue chips like these are selling at such a steep discount, you can invest with confidence, knowing strong total returns likely lie in your future.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bottom Line: These Time Tested Blue Chips Are Great Buys Right Now</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Cyclical industrial stocks are not where one would assume you look for safe and steadily growing dividends. However, in reality the ranks of dividend aristocrats are chock full of world class industrial companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Illinois Tools Works and <span>A.O. Smith are two of my favorite industrial aristocrats, thanks to their 54 and 26 years of consecutive dividend growth, respectively. These companies have proven that their strong competitive advantages, long-term focused and shareholder friendly management cultures, and ability to dominate strong growth markets, makes them great places to invest your hard earned money.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Today, despite booming businesses, both stocks are deeply undervalued, thanks to Wall Street's fears over trade wars, a rising US dollar, and short-term margin pressure. However, that just means that today is the best time in nearly 10 years to add these Grade A blue chips to your diversified dividend growth portfolio.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That's because ITW and AOS are about 28% and 39% undervalued right now. Combined with their strong long-term growth potential, that translates into likely 15% and 18.5% annualized returns over the coming years. That's not just better than what the S&amp;P 500 is likely to deliver, but far superior to what most aristocrats and kings can likely deliver.</p>", "twitContent": "$AOS $ITW - Cash In On The Trade War By Buying These 2 Fast-Growing Dividend Aristocrats. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4212355-cash-in-on-trade-war-buying-2-fast-growing-dividend-aristocrats?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I am Dividend Sensei, aka Adam Galas - an Army vet and trained stock analyst.
