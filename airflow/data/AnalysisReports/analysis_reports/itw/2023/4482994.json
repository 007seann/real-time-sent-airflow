Although past performance is not a guarantee<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> of future results, the underlying long-term trend (where the 50-month moving average has acted as support) certainly remains bullish. When we see charts like this, it invariably means that the company has been able to consistently demonstrate strong earnings power. The consensus EPS estimate comes in at approximately $8.26 per share for this present fiscal year. If indeed achieved, this would be a whopping 24%+ bottom-line increase over fiscal 2020.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2022/1/29/932120-16435033708609498_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"700\" data-height=\"639\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2022/1/29/932120-16435033708609498.png\" alt=\"ITW bullish run over the past decade\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"640\" height=\"584\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ITW bullish run</p> <p>https://stockcharts.com/</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The price we pay matters however which is why we need to be able to calculate the intrinsic value of the stock. This can be a difficult task but a worthwhile one because any long investment in ITW at the right valuation in recent times would have paid handsome dividends. On the contrary, when one buys a stock with strong earnings power such as Illinois Tools at the wrong price, returns can turn out to be abysmal over time. Therefore let's see if ITW is an attractive deal based on its current share price. Essentially our decision will be dictated by comparing the future earnings potential of the company with the current asking price in the market at present.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The first step is to project earnings growth over the next five years for example. Since earnings per share came in at $5.70 in fiscal 2016 and have risen to $8.60 over a trailing 12-month average, we can say that EPS growth over the last five years (less one quarter) has come in at just over 50%. When we average this out annually, we see that EPS has grown by roughly 10% on average per year during this time frame. Suffice it to say, this is the growth rate (10%) we want from our ITW investment over the next five years. This would bring <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463101-illinois-tool-works-inc-itw-ceo-scott-santi-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings</a> per share to approximately $13.85 in five years time</li> <li>The next step is to predict an earnings multiple for Illinois Tool Works. Despite the excellent growth we have seen in recent times from ITW, we are going to be conservative by dialing down the company\u00b4s current price to earnings ratio. At present, ITW shares trade with a GAAP earnings multiple of almost 27 which is not far from the S&amp;P average which comes in at 25.2. We do not expect that ITW will be able to trade at this valuation indefinitely which is why we are going to dial it back to the S&amp;P long-term average of 17. Therefore by multiplying 17 by our projected EPS of $13.85 per share, we get a projected share price of $235.45</li> <li>However, ITW is a proven <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3760914-illinois-tool-works-inc-declares-1_22-dividend\">dividend</a> growth stock having grown its payout now for the past 26 years. The current payout ratio comes in at approximately 55%. Therefore if we add up ITW's projected earnings per the next five years ($9.46, $10.41, $11.45, $12.59, $13.85 = $57.76 ) and multiply this number by the pay-out ratio, we see that approximately $31.77 is expected to be paid out in dividends by ITW over this time-frame. By adding this number to our calculated projection above, we get a total stock price of $267.21 at the end of year five.</li> <li>As we can see, based on an earnings growth rate of 10% and a forward earnings multiple of 17, our projected stock price five years from now ($267.21) is not that far from ITW\u00b4s present share price ($231.75). Based on these numbers, the growth rate in the share price only works out at approximately 3% per year on average over the 5-year period. Suffice it to say, even if we lowered our growth expectations and just looked for something like a 7% total return on our investment in ITW, what price would we need to buy the stock in order to realize this growth rate? We calculate this by dividing our projected share price in each year (Year 5 = $267.21) by 1.07 for each of the 5 years. The result is that our entry price comes in at approximately $190 per share accordingly.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore to sum up, although ITW continues to go from strength to strength with respect to its earnings growth, <strong>we are conscious that our returns are lower when we are willing to go long the investment at a higher valuation</strong>. Based on our number crunching, we would be happy to get long here around the $190 mark assuming the fundamentals of the company do not change. Let's see if a buying opportunity can present itself shortly. We look forward to continued coverage.</p>", "twitContent": "$ITW - Illinois Tool Works: Wait For A Better Entry. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4482994-illinois-tool-works-wait-for-a-better-entry?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>----------------------<span></p><p>Elevation Code's blueprint is simple.
