The stock<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> has returned about 20% since my initial write-up versus a 7% increase in the S&amp;P. With the company recently reporting earnings, let\u2019s catch up on the name.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Q3 Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Earlier this month, WMB reported its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4028409-williams-non-gaap-eps-of-0_45-beats-0_04-revenue-of-2_56b-misses-30m\">Q3 results</a>, with adjusted EBITDA up 1%, or $15 million, to $1.65 billion. Adjusted EPS was 45 cents, down -6%. Gathering volumes rose 6% year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB's Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment saw its adjusted EBITDA rise 14.7% to $748 million. The results were helped by its MountainWest and NorTex Midstream acquisitions and favorable costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Its Northeast Gathering segment, meanwhile, saw adjusted EBITDA rise 4.5% to $485 million, helped by increased gathering rates and volume. The results were powered by its Ohio Valley Midstream JV, Cardinal system, Susquehanna Supply Hub, Marcellus South and Blue Racer JV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Its West segment saw EBITDA decline -6.5% to $315 million, hurt by lower NYMEX-based rates in the Barnett. Its Gas and NGL Marketing Service segment saw adjusted EBITDA of $16 million versus $38 million a year ago. The segment is seasonally sensitive, and was hurt by less volatility versus a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB generated $1.230 billion in cash flow from operations, down -17% versus a year ago. Available fund from operations slipped -1% to $1.23 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company ended the quarter with leverage of 3.5x. It had a dividend coverage ratio of 2.3x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB did some wheeling and dealing in Q3. It sold its Bayou Ethane system for $348 million in cash, getting a 14x adjusted EBITDA multiple for the asset, which is really good price. Meanwhile, it purchased the 50% stake in Rocky Mountain Midstream it didn\u2019t already own from KKR, as well as acquiring gas gathering pipelines and two processing plants in the DJ. The two acquisition cost $1.27 billion, and were purchased at 7x 2024 adjusted EBITDA. The two deals are expected to close by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This was a steady quarter from WMB. Its base business grew about 6%, but some of the more commodity sensitive parts of its business did knock down year over year growth. That\u2019s a small part of its business, but it can have an impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, it showed some nice strength in its Transmission and Northeast G&amp;P business, while it made two acquisitions to strengthen its position in the DJ. Overall, it was a solid but unspectacular quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking ahead, the company guided for full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $6.6-6.8 billion. That compares to a prior outlook of $6.4-6.8 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is looking for adjusted income of between $2.175-2.325 billion, or $1.78-1.90 per share. That compares to a prior outlook of $2.05-2.35 billion, or $1.67-1.92 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB has project available funds from operations of $5.075-5.275 billion. AFFO per common share is projected to be between $4.09-4.26. It expects its coverage ratio to be between 2.29-2.39x. Those projections are up from its previous outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is looking to end the year with leverage of 3.65x, and to grow its dividend by 5.3% for the year. That is unchanged from prior guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company continued to forecast between $1.6-1.9 billion in growth capex.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/10/906212-16996368510438561_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3562\" data-height=\"1572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/10/906212-16996368510438561.png\" alt=\"WMB Growth Projects\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Presentation </span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Discussing gro<span class=\"highlighted_text\">wth projects on its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4646605-williams-companies-inc-wmb-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4623394-williams-companies-inc-wmb-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q3 earnings call</a>, CE</span>O Alan Armstrong said:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>\u201cThe really big news this quarter comes in the new project's call. We recently signed precedent agreements of over 1.4 Bcf a day for the Southeast Supply Enhancement project, which provides takeaway capacity from our Transco Station 165 to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. And based on the open season results, we have even more demand to be met in the future that would result likely in a follow-on project. So we are proceeding into the permitting process for this initial project due to the urgent demands to be met for this first group of customers. So in terms of impact, this will be the largest addition of EBITDA ever for a Williams Pipeline extension, yes, even more than our Atlantic Sunrise project and, in fact, significantly more than the entire EBITDA generated from our Northwest Pipeline system. And I'll remind you that these are 20-year contracts from the time the project starts up, which would be at least through 2047. And we recently signed anchor shipper precedent agreements for a Uinta Basin expansion on our MountainWest system. We continue to be very pleased with the successful integration of the Mountain West assets into our operations and the opportunities we see to execute on more profitable growth with this asset than we had originally planned on. In fact, this is the second piece of substantial business that we have signed up just this year on the MountainWest Pipelines. And neither of which of these expansions, neither of these were in our pro forma for this acquisition. So really pleased with the team from MountainWest Pipeline and the leadership we have working to grow that business, but very pleasantly surprised with that acquisition to date.\u201d</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When I last looked at WMB, I said the company\u2019s 2H forecast looked very conservative, and typically the company sees seasonally stronger results in the second half compared to the first half, where it posted $3.4 billion in EBITDA. The fourth quarter tends to be its strongest quarter seasonally, so that the midpoint of its increased guidance is the same as Q3 once again tells me that its Q4 guidance looks conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The bar for Q4 continues to look low to me. Meanwhile, the company looks like it has a lot of nice growth projects set to be completed by the end of this year and into Q1 of next year, that should help power 2024 growth. Its two acquisitions in the DJ Basin should also be a boost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Further out, it has a number of steady projects set to come online between 2024-26. In addition, its Southeast Expansion project looks like a really nice growth project, although that is not expected to come online until late 2027, so it won\u2019t impact results until 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB trades at 9.4x the 2023 EBITDA consensus of $6.72 billion. Based on the 2024 EBITDA consensus of $6.82 billion, it is valued at 9.3x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The stock has an attractive free cash flow yield of about 9.9% based on my 2023 projections calling for $4.2 billion in FCF. The stock has a yield of about 5.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">WMB trades towards the middle where other large midstream operates are currently trading. However, given how valuable its demand-pull assets in the Southeast are and the number of growth projects still ahead of it in the region, I think the company deserves to trade at a premium. Given its solid performance and increasing forecasts, I\u2019m going to raise my price target from $42 to $43, which is still an under 11x multiple on 2024 EBITDA.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/10/906212-16996368004071217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1302\" data-height=\"764\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/10/906212-16996368004071217.png\" alt=\"WMB Valuation Vs Peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"376\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"376\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">WMB Valuation Vs Peers <span>(FinBox)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While it may not be one of the cheapest stocks in the midstream space, it arguably owns the most valuation pipeline in North America in Transco. The company is also able to use this pipeline to fuel further growth through related projects stemming off of Transco, with the Southeast Supply Enhancement project just being the latest example.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a strong balance sheet, well covered dividend, and plenty of growth opportunities in front of it, I continue to rate WMB stock a \u201cBuy.\u201d</p>", "twitContent": "$WMB - The Williams Companies: 2024 Set-Up Looks Good With Growth Projects Set To Come
