For example, we have long supported toy and game maker Hasbro\u2019s (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content invisible\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) management and board on strategic, operational and ESG-related topics; the company ranks highly on almost all areas of ESG evaluation, including diversity at board and all-employee levels. We maintain long-term relationships with Hasbro management, and in April 2022, after an activist shareholder started pushing for strategic change at the company, we stepped up our dialogue with senior management and the board.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While we appreciate some of the concerns raised by the activist, we were against most of its suggestions, which we believed would be destructive to long-term shareholder value. We did not believe it was in our best interest to replace three board members with activist-nominated board members \u2014 the existing board is replete with talent from the media, technology, content, gaming, entertainment and social media industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over multiple meetings with Hasbro\u2019s CEO and CFO and as many as three board members, our strong relationships helped us better understand what changes would be made where appropriate, and what strategies would remain intact. We had frequent opportunity to share our thoughts on board composition, long-term strategic priorities, compensation, capital allocation and disclosures. All of these became import topics for review during this time. In June 2022 the activist\u2019s proposals were rejected by shareholders. We remain in support of management as it continues on its path of brand-building and growing digital content for its customers.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <div
