Revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $766 million, well below consensus estimates. Earnings per share, adjusted for a one-time charge, also came in below consensus expectations, falling 12% year-over-year to $0.29. Year-to-date, free cash flow is up to 66% to $245 million, <strong>which equates to 17% of revenues</strong> (an excellent number).</p> <p>Though headline numbers weren't quite as strong as anticipated, the market is focused on the contract extension Hasbro inked with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) to keep Marvel and Star Wars products exclusive to Hasbro. We're not surprised by the deal extension, but some market participants may have worried that Disney would bring toy production in-house to increase profitability. Hasbro will pay $225 million for Star Wars, with $75 million coming in the form of an upfront payment in the third quarter. Hasbro will also owe Disney at least $80 million in royalty payments related to Marvel during the next seven years, which we think will be a cinch to meet with additional sales expansion. Maintaining the partnership should leave Hasbro well-positioned to benefit from new Marvel and Star Wars films that will come to market over the next few years.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/1/saupload_HAS_2Q_2013_I.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/1/saupload_HAS_2Q_2013_I_thumb1.jpg\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Image Source: HAS Q2 FY2013 Investor Presentation</p> <p>As for Hasbro's quarterly performance, the firm struggled mightily to lap strong comparisons in its Boys segment, where sales declined 35% year-over-year to $254 million. The decline was so drastic that Boys slipped to the second-largest segment at Hasbro. We ultimately believe the lack of blockbuster entertainment releases can explain a great deal of the decline, though it's no secret that attention is being diverted by the excitement of innovative digital video games. However, we expect Hasbro to invest heavily in cross-platform products, ones where kids will be able to interact digitally and physically with toys.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Disney Contract Extension Outshines Weak Revenue Growth At Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/1594452-disney-contract-extension-outshines-weak-revenue-growth-at-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24491", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "86", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "34650", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/1594452-disney-contract-extension-outshines-weak-revenue-growth-at-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/1594452-disney-contract-extension-outshines-weak-revenue-growth-at-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/1/saupload_HAS_2Q_2013_I.jpg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/1/saupload_HAS_2Q_2013_I.jpg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "24491", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "valuentum", "userId": 933684, "tagId": 34650, "bio": "<p>We offer subscriptions and exclusive newsletters.
