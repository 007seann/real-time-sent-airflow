The Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIA\" title=\"SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF\">DIA</a>) is up 19.36%, the S&amp;P500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) up 23.69%, and the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ONEQ\" title=\"Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF\">ONEQ</a>) is up 30.48% for the year. However, all three major indices are a bit off their highs of late. The market seems a bit choppy here with some intraday swings, and that is why I believe in purchasing bargain dividend stocks. Because the market is at all-time highs again I maintain that it is still difficult to find good stocks these days. That's why I'm highlighting a select set of excellent value companies in my dividend growth portfolio which have had ex-dividend dates or paid out a dividend during this past week or early next week that people should place on their radar.</p> <p><strong>Eaton Corporation PLC (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETN\" title=\"Eaton Corporation plc\">ETN</a></span>)</strong></p> <p>Eaton is a global technology leader in electrical components to the aerospace and automotive industries, both of which are hot industries right now. On 25Oct13, Eaton reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $1.12 per share. This result was in-line with the consensus of the 22 analysts following the company and beat last year's third quarter results by 4.67%. Eaton's PE ratio is below the electronic instruments &amp; controls industry average and signals that investors are not willing to pay a premium for this stock, making it a value stock. However, during the past year, earnings growth has lagged its historical five year growth rate.</p> <p>The company went ex-dividend on 31Oct13 with a $0.42 per share dividend which will be paid on 22Nov13 for a yield of 2.38%. It was a pretty quiet week in terms of news pertaining to the company specifically with no press releases being issued. Let's take a quick look at<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> the technicals here to see if it can be bought at these levels or if a pullback is coming. As we can see, the relative strength index is in middle ground territory with a current value of 58.85, while the MACD chart below shows the black line above the red line but with downward trajectory and decreasing divergence bars, meaning there may be some downward pressure on the stock price. I anticipate the stock to drop for now especially after the spike it saw on earnings and then I will be buying shares.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/11/6808631_13834120714926_rId5.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/11/6808631_13834120714926_rId5_thumb.jpg\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Hasbro, Inc (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro, Inc. is engaged in providing leisure time products with a portfolio of brands and entertainment properties ranging from Transformers to Monopoly and My Little Pony. On 21Oct13, Hasbro reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $1.31 per share. This result beat the consensus of the 13 analysts following the company by two cents and beat last year's third quarter results by 5.65%. Hasbro's PE ratio is below the recreational products industry average and signals that investors are not willing to pay a premium for this stock, making it a value stock. However, during the past year, earnings growth has lagged its historical five year growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company went ex-dividend on 30Oct13 with a $0.40 per share dividend which will be paid on 15Nov13 for a yield of 3.09%. It was also a pretty quiet week in terms of news pertaining to the company specifically with no press releases being issued. Let's take a quick look at the technicals here to see if it can be bought at these levels or if a pullback is coming. As we can see, the relative strength index is in overbought territory with a current value of 69.1, while the MACD chart below shows the black line above the red line but with downward trajectory and decreasing divergence bars, meaning there may be some downward pressure on the stock price.

It is important in this market to be able to hold onto companies which raise their dividend rates, because it is a sign that the underlying company is doing well financially. The importance of these stocks I've highlighted is that they are value plays while the broader market is at all-time highs. I believe we are at a point in the market where we have to look for value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disclaimer: These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework.
