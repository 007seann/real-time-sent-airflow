This is a metric that popular SA author David Van Knapp uses. The idea is that you want to see consistent growth.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">DripInvesting.org</a> spreadsheet, the following metrics show that the dividends appear sustainable. (However, the current 10 year growth rate may not be.)</p> <ul> <li>The current dividend yield is between 2 to 2.5 percent, which is a typical yield for dividend paying companies in general.</li> <li>The payout ratio is 53.4%, which means about half are paid out to shareholders and half remain with the company. I have seen as much as 75% maximum recommended for a company to pay out in earnings and<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> still grow the dividends. However, I am personally comfortable with about 50% because I feel the company will not be able to grow if most of the earnings are given to shareholders.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The 1, 3, 5, and 10 year growth rates are 7.1%, 9.5%, 13.8%, and 18.6%, respectively. Although these numbers are currently high, I do not want to be optimistic and hope for these kind of growth rates to continue. Given that the growth rates for the 1, 3, and 5 year are less than the 10 year average, it makes me believe that there is a tendency for a slower growth. The 10% annual growth that dividend growth investors seek might be iffy. However, the growth will most certainly be above the rate of inflation.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Assuming that inflation gets to the historical 2% level, the nominal increase from dividends assuming annualized growth rates between 5 to 9% but below 10% for the next 10 years are the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/25/14794022-14721744945602722.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" data-width=\"449\" data-height=\"261\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source:Self-created)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, I will assume that 100 shares were bought. Thus, the total return from the dividends assuming the stock price stays at 80 dollars is the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/25/14794022-1472175283966843.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" data-width=\"463\" data-height=\"401\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source:Self-created)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Note: <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow\">2016 dividends</a> were only used to calculate growth values. This model assumes you start receiving dividends from 2017 going forward.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the total return appears juicy, pay attention to the annualized return. The difference is marginal because the annualized return from dividends is between 3 to 3.5%,which means to get the historical, total annualized return of 10%, the stock price needs to increase by 6 to 7% annually. This is very feasible.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In any one of these scenarios, about 33% of the annualized returns comes from Hasbro's dividends assuming a 10% historical return. This tells me that even if Hasbro's dividends fail to grow at the desired annual 10% growth rate, returns from dividends will still be very attractive. Historically, 33% of total annual returns have come from dividends.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: Feel Like A Kid Again. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4002303-hasbro-feel-like-kid-again?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "69145", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "162535", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4002303-hasbro-feel-like-kid-again", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4002303-hasbro-feel-like-kid-again", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/25/14794022-14721627824442258_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/25/14794022-14721627824442258_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "69145", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "ravi-bala", "userId": 14794022, "tagId": 162535, "bio": "<p><br></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static2.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/014/794/022/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static2.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/014/794/022/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static2.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/014/794/022/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static2.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/014/794/022/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Ravi Bala", "deactivated": true, "memberSince": 2013, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 619}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "14794022", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": []}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/ravi-bala", "profileUrl": "/user/14794022", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "162535", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "ravi-bala", "name": "Ravi Bala", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/ravi-bala"}}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dividend-ideas", "name": "Dividend Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=dividend-ideas"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-income", "name": "Dividends & Income", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-income"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
