However, if I were already holding it, the total return expectation is reasonable enough that I would not sell it.

Strong sales drove this, particularly from girls' toys and dolls, led by Disney's Princess and Trolls. Games also performed well during the quarter, led by MAGIC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite the earnings beat, keep in mind that the company has beaten consensus most of the time in the last five years, so it is likely that they guide Wall Street conservatively in order to \"surprise\" on the upside and have more room to work with in case things go wrong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The main worrying sign was unusually high inventory build. Management attributes this to new product launches, which is in line with strong performance during the quarter. However, there is always the risk of being stuck with too much inventory if management over-estimates demand, leading to a potential for write-downs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management indicated that fourth quarter margins may be down year over year due to a variety of investment-oriented spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/18/47589471-14821197061460774_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"868\" data-height=\"654\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/18/47589471-14821197061460774.png\" alt=\"HAS Q3 Strong Points\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"482\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Valuation Opportunity</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Forward P/E currently stands at 17.9X, a premium to the company's five-year average of 16.1X, but at somewhat of a discount to the market's ~19X forward multiple. It also trades at a slight premium to its closest competitor, Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>)'s, 16.5X forward multiple. It is also a bit high vs. history on an EV/EBITDA basis. Long-term, HAS's forward P/E trading range is around 12-20X.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As we're well into a bull market and most companies are in the upper half of their trading range, we need to look to yield and earnings growth for the bulk of total return potential. To that end, HAS's dividend yield stands at 2.5%, a little above average and in line with the 10-year treasury yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unlike treasuries, however, the dividend is likely to grow with earnings. Consensus estimates have the company's EPS growing at 7% per annum through 2020. Looking back at the company's actual results versus estimated results over the last five years, it looks far more likely to surprise on the upside than on the downside. So using this 7% growth rate appears to be a reasonable base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With the 2.5% yield, that suggests a possible 9-10% total return potential per year, which is fairly attractive given the alternatives available at the market's lofty current valuation. Applying a high 20X multiple to 2018 estimated earnings of $4.81 gives a $96 price target, implying over 20% total return potential, including two years of dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, if the market corrects, a fall toward the low end of the company's trading range (12X forward P/E) implies a downside of over 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So while I don't anticipate a bear market (it seems we never do), it's always important to keep the downside in mind in terms of market exposure and hedging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Key Risks</b></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><li>Manufacturing in China and Mexico.
