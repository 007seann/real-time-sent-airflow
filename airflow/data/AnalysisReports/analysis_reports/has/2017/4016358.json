This shift most notably impacted our US POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 Star Wars' revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015.\"</p></blockquote> <p>A lot rides on this statement given that Star Wars The Force Awakens contributed in the fourth quarter 2015 more than 15% of Hasbro's total sales. It hence behooves us to see where Rogue One is today in relation to The Force Awakens and whether Brian Goldner's assertion is realistic.</p> <p>There are several parameters we are looking at - movie cannibalization, shelf space, retail sales movement and consumer interest as expressed in social media. Since Action Figures' sales represented more than a quarter of Hasbro's total sales in 2015, it is appropriate that we are focusing on this category.</p> <p>Firstly, there is plenty of evidence that too closely spaced sequels do not do particularly well either in terms of box office or in terms of toy sales, particularly action figure sales. Rogue is extremely close to The Force since there in only a year between the two. In addition, there is the factor of competition between movies for consumer Dollars since the majority of parents will only spend so much on movie-related toy purchases. Rogue finds itself in a much more competitive environment than The Force did:</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2015</strong></p> <p><strong>Date</strong></p> </td> <td><p><strong>Title</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Licensee</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td> <p><strong>2016</strong></p> <p><strong>Date</strong></p> </td> <td><p><strong>Title</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Licensee</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>07/10</p></td> <td><p>Minions</p></td> <td><p>Think Way</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>07/14</p></td> <td><p>Ghostbusters</p></td> <td><p>Mattel</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>07/17</p></td> <td><p>Ant Man</p></td> <td><p>Hasbro</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>07/27</p></td> <td><p>Star Trek</p></td> <td><p>Mattel</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>12/18</p></td> <td><p>Star Wars The Force Awakens</p></td> <td><p>Hasbro</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>10/14</p></td> <td><p>Max Steel</p></td> <td><p>Mattel</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>10/21</p></td> <td><p>Ouija</p></td> <td><p>Hasbro</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p>10/26</p></td> <td><p>Dr. Strange</p></td> <td><p>Hasbro</p></td> </tr> </table> </span></span>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Star Wars Rogue One Is Expected To Disappoint. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4016358-star-wars-rogue-one-is-expected-to-disappoint?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "48741", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "102761", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1302", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "2227", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "549886", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "142851", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "543406", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4016358-star-wars-rogue-one-is-expected-to-disappoint", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4016358-star-wars-rogue-one-is-expected-to-disappoint", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/10/26/435974-1477502913832119_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/10/26/435974-1477502913832119_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "48741", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "lutz-muller", "userId": 435974, "tagId": 102761, "bio": "Lutz is an acknowledged expert on the toy space.

This panel provides him with sell-through data, shelf space changes, inventory levels and other pertinent metrics governing the major companies and products active in the two industry categories. The second is national buyers at 30 leading retailers in 17 large country markets. These provide color on trends and issues that have a bearing on the major manufacturers and products in the two industry categories. The last is mainly Chinese third-party manufacturers who provide insights into supply and inventory issues affecting the major companies or products in the two industry categories.<br><br></p><p>Lutz consults with banks and hedge funds, and hence does not trade in any stocks associated with companies active in the spaces he focuses on.
