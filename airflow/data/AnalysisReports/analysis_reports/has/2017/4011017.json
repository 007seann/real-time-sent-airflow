While it may mostly be filled with artists and game creators just looking to break out of the mold, big labels such as Hasbro (NASDAQ: <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) are using the opportunity to demo their big holiday line-up of action figures. In this case, it's <a href=\"https://dorksideoftheforce.com/2016/10/06/nycc-learned-hasbro-star-wars-panel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Star Wars miniatures line that has everybody buzzing at the convention</a>, and hopefully, will have investors buzzing come Q4.</p> <p><b>A Journey into Rogue One</b></p> <p>While Hasbro is a multi-headed toy empire, it was its Star Wars line last year that helped it turn in a very strong Q4 thanks to Disney's (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/star-wars-boosts-hasbro-sales-1454935536\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 13 percent overall revenue rise and a 35 percent increase in boys' toy sales</a>. With <i>Rogue One</i> coming out this year, there is ample opportunity for Hasbro to strike twice, this time with a nod towards the past and future of the series.</p> <p>Given that <i>Rogue One</i>, according to the cinematic trailer, seems to take place in between the events of the prequel and original trilogies, Hasbro has gone with offering different lines for kids as well as nostalgic adults in an attempt to bridge the two (maybe three) generations of Star Wars fans. For kids, there is the Galactic Heroes series, billed by Hasbro at their panel on Thursday morning as a kid-friendly introduction to the new series. A little more cartoony than they appear in the movies, these feature Kylo Ren and AT-AT figurines for kids<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to enjoy, among other largely newer characters.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For adults though, there is the Black Series of action figures, which is a bold move for a toy company like Hasbro to make these figurines for older customers, but given that it is a franchise like Star Wars, it may not be a surprise if adults are getting their hands on them as well. A little more detailed, and with an artistry that is more adult accessible, it leans heavily on characters like Baze Malbus and Darth Vader, who will be showing up a new <i>Rogue One</i>-specific outfit, which keeps the two lines separate but complimentary in terms of boosting Hasbro sales -- a key point around Christmas time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Should Rogue One match the now lofty expectations for the new triology, the toys would follow suit, so it would be critical for investors to eye box office returns for the movie for clues as to Hasbro's quarterly performance, which will ride largely on the long Dark Side of the Force coattails of the release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>But what about the girls?</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While last year was seen as a sales success for Hasbro, one worrying moment was the controversy regarding a lack of Rey toys for girls, as well as a general underperformance in the girls' toy market for Hasbro. The controversy last year took prominence because of Rey's uniqueness as a female action hero, and there were worries as to why she wasn't prominently featured in Hasbro's toy line. Hasbro explained that the Rey toys were held until January because some of the features (such as her with a lightsaber) were potential spoilers and they wanted to wait until the movie was out in theaters before selling them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even still, girls' toys for Hasbro showed a 17 percent decline last year, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and the NYCC preview still showed a predominantly male-targeted line, likely due to Rogue One's position in the Star Wars universe. For this, it can be expected that Hasbro is going to fully leverage its rights to Disney princess toys, which were a $500 million coup from Mattel (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) to target that demographic with familiar and popular characters from the more traditional Disney portfolio. Yet going around the show floor, there is an increasing demand for female characters to be more than just princesses, and Disney has gone that direction with movies like <i>Frozen. </i>But it's a different business in the action and adventure genre, which could use more representation in the toy department to compliment what is going on in movies and TV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Playing Hasbro - with real money</b></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Traditionally for retail, the fourth quarter is its strongest quarter thanks to the holiday shopping season, and it was for Hasbro as well with <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/194075/hasbro-has-beats-q3-earnings-revenue-estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\">a near 16 percent share price hike post earnings</a>, and a 33 percent price hike up until May to cap off the first quarter. The stock has slipped a bit since then, and with a generally tough quarter soon to report, it may not be much to write home about here either. Yet with a little patience, investors could have an opportunity to play the holiday season either after the post-earnings bump, or play a potential disappointment in earnings. Either way, if Hasbro can keep the Star Wars gravy train going, and fully capitalize on its Disney princess line swipe, the force could be very strong indeed for Hasbro.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS -
