The net income attributable to Hasbro's shareholders was $52.1M, resulting in an EPS of $<a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=46080-16-193&amp;CIK=46080\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.42</a> for the quarter, and $0.80 for the first semester.

That's really strong, considering the contribution from changes in its working capital was approximately<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 25% lower than the previous year. This allowed Hasbro to generate an adjusted operating cash flow of $224M and an adjusted free cash flow of $158M in the first half of the current financial year (compared to just $110M in H1 FY 2015).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Even though Hasbro loves to treat its shareholders, it's not spending more than it can afford</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, the net income increased by 45%, whilst the adjusted free cash flow increased by 44%, yet the company's share price got hit by a high single digit percentage price drop.

Sure, the economic future looks a bit more shaky now with all the Brexit votes and coup d'\u00e9tat's in the world, but keep in mind Hasbro starts the second half of the year with a $48M head start compared to its results in the previous financial year. Additionally, the impact of Star Wars will continue to decrease, but we have always known the majority of the Star Wars-related revenue wouldn't be recurring. Besides, every (other) year a new hype pops up, so Hasbro should be able to deal with lower revenues from the Star Wars division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That being said, I also like the way how Hasbro is allocating its free cash flow. Most companies are currently in a 'repurchase race' and try to reduce their share count no matter what, but Hasbro is playing a more strategic game.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/saupload_57e9bce5caee6022bdb050868bc45a93.png\" alt=\"HAS Cash from Operations (Annual) Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/cash_operations_annual\" dofollow=\"true\">HAS Cash from Operations (Annual)</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\">YCharts</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's now assume the company's full-year free cash flow will be exactly the same as last year ($540M, despite the strong start of the year). This means that after paying the approximately $250M in dividends, Hasbro will have $290M available for a variety of purposes. Most companies tend to borrow cash to buy back more stock than they can actually afford, but Hasbro is very disciplined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It did spend quite a bit of cash on buybacks (almost $160M, to repurchase almost 0.75M shares), but Hasbro also repaid $160M of debt from its existing cash position, and that's an important factor. Whilst most companies are increasing the net debt exactly to fund their repurchase programs, Hasbro is reducing its gross debt, which will reduce its interest expenses (see later).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's take a step back and have another look at Hasbro's income statement. The total interest expense in the first half of the year was approximately $48M (vs $49M in H1 FY 2015), so it's actually in Hasbro's interest to reduce the gross debt as fast as possible as this will have a huge impact on the interest bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Investment thesis</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro now has a free cash flow yield of approximately 5-5.5% (depending on its H2 results) and whilst that's not cheap, it's the price you pay for a strong cash flowing company with a decent balance sheet in this ZIRP/NIRP society.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Keep in mind Hasbro's debt will only gradually decrease as the maturity date of its notes has been spread <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/2455635967x0xS46080-16-156/46080/filing.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">out over time</a> (see the previous image). However, should Hasbro decide to repay the bond maturing in 2017 (which it definitely should do, considering it's high-cost debt and Hasbro has plenty of cash to repay the note), its interest expenses will decrease by $22M per year, boosting the free cash flow by $15M\u2026</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I just wish the company was able to repay a part of its remaining debt as well, but that will be quite difficult considering the premium Hasbro would have to pay. That being said, simply repaying the 2017 bond will increase the free cash flow by 12 cents per share, and this confirms my impression the market shouldn't really have punished Hasbro for its financial results. The current 'crash' will increase the volatility in the option market, and I might write an out of the money put option to try to get an initial long position at a lower price.</p> </div>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Financials Weren't That Bad. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3989342-hasbros-financials-werent-bad?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I am the Investment Doctor.
