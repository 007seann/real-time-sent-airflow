Hasbro's Rogue One offerings are expected to be among the <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2016/09/08/15-toys-that-toys-r-us-says-will-top-christmas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">15 most sought-after toys</a> this holiday season.</p> <p>Investors looking to build a representative portfolio of stocks may wish to include Hasbro, one of the world's preeminent toy makers. In addition to licensing properties such as Star Wars, it also owns iconic gaming brands such as Magic: The Gathering and classic American toy brands such as My Little Pony, Play-Doh, and Nerf. This stable of brands and licensing partnerships enable Hasbro to have <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=979849\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">relatively stable revenues</a> in an industry that is generally highly cyclical.</p> <p>Hasbro has also paid a regular dividend since 1977 and has raised its dividend each year since 2010 and in twelve of the last thirteen years. At 2.62%, Hasbro's current dividend yield is above that of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-peyield.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">average S&amp;P500 company</a>. Thus, investors who buy $10,000 worth of Hasbro's shares can expect to receive passive annual income of around $262 with some expectation that these payments will rise over time.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Focus On What You Do Best: Selling Toys. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4007662-focus-on-what-you-best-selling-toys?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "45851", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "99021", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4007662-focus-on-what-you-best-selling-toys", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4007662-focus-on-what-you-best-selling-toys", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "45851", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "black-coral-research", "userId": 9714771, "tagId": 99021, "bio": "<p>Black Coral Research, Inc. is a newsletter designed to inform Dividend Investors how the latest news could impact the dividends of the companies they invest in.
