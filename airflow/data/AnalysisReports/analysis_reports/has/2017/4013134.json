I have described many times the phenomenon that occurs every now and again known as the 'toy-cycle.' This cycle presents itself where new products are released year-after-year piggybacking on successful movies or other entertainment related venues. I have said it before and I will say it again. All major toy companies have been good stocks to own and trade over the last few years. We know toy companies have moved away from traditional toys and board games into more interactive products. The traditional toy industry is still kicking, but technology like electronic/computer-based toys, apps and complex interactive toys are now extremely popular. Hasbro is a stock I have called a winner.</p> <p>That said, what can we expect looking ahead? I think Hasbro is set to continue its churn higher as it has just announced its most recent earnings report and it reveals some clues about the consumer and threats to the company, but also provides a basis for where the sector may be heading. I never expect much out of the third quarter as there are no major gift giving holidays. Summer blockbusters have come and gone. To my surprise this quarter was actually rather strong, at least on the headline numbers. It delivered a strong top line and bottom line beat versus analyst estimates. Net revenues for Hasbro's Q3 2016 were 14% higher year-over-year. Revenues were $1.68 billion beating estimates by a strong $120 million.</p> <p>Now, as I have discussed in most articles this earnings season, the strong dollar has been a major issue for many domestic companies with international sales. It has, of course, impacted Hasbro which does a lot of international businesses. So if we look at revenues on a constant dollar basis, it would back out a $2.8 million impact. That is incredible strength in<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> sales. Net earnings for the quarter were up an incredible 24%. They came in at $257 million or $2.03 per share. This is a solid improvement year-over-year. As a whole earnings beat by a solid $0.29.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So sales continue to be pretty strong and the company is managing expenses leading to strong earnings. Digging a little deeper into the performance, we see that Hasbro's U.S. and Canada segment brought in net revenues of $932.8 million for the quarter compared to $803.8 million for the comparable 2015 quarter. This is a 16% increase year-over-year. There was growth in the Girls and Games product categories but saw some declines in the Preschool and Boys category. The segment reported operating profit of $228 million. This is a nearly a 25% gain from the $187 million in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Internationally, things rebounded. As a whole, net revenues were $691 million compared to $613 million in the comparable 2015 quarter. There was growth in all product categories except the Games category. On a regional basis, Europe was up 16%, Latin America grew 9%, while Asia-Pacific was up 1%. Interestingly emerging markets saw revenues jump 15%. However, the key is to look at this on a constant dollar basis. Excluding an unfavorable $17 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues in the International Segment grew 15%, increasing 24% in Europe, 11% in Latin America and was about flat in Asia. On a constant dollar basis the International Segment operating profit was $133.1 million, an increase of 17% versus 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Turning to the Entertainment and Licensing segment, this key business division saw net revenues jump 8% year-over-year. Net revenues were $56.1 million compared to $52.1 million in 2015. For the most part this was a result of growth in the Consumer Products and Digital Gaming. However, due to higher expenditures operating profit in this segment declined 13% to $14.1 million. Commenting on the quarter, Brian Goldner, Hasbro's president and CEO stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"quote paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>\"Innovative play experiences, engaging storytelling and global execution of Hasbro's Brand Blueprint continues to drive consumer and retailer demand for our brand portfolio. 2016 has been a strong year, including our third quarter - which marked the greatest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history. We are well positioned for what we believe will be a good holiday season.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The quote tells me that the 'toy cycle' is in full swing. Looking ahead, I continue to like the company. The company is fundamentally strong as a whole and is delivering in a somewhat tough environment. The company has long been reliable. I love the shareholder-friendly nature of the company. Hasbro paid $64 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the quarter. The company recently its dividend 11% to $0.51 per share quarterly. On top of the nice dividend, the company also has a repurchase plan in place. Hasbro repurchased approximately 598,800 shares of common stock at a total cost of $48.4 million, at an average price of $80.87 per share. The company still has $373 million available in the current share repurchase authorization. When this stock dips, buy it for the long-term. The stock is a winner.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><i>Note from the author: Christopher F.
