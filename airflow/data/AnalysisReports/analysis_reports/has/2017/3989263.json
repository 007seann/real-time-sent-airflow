We think this sell-off on what was a strong quarter provides investors a strong buying opportunity, with around 15% upside over the next 6 months.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/saupload_587f9f74bbc81eae5e491df8886babba.png\" alt=\"HAS Price Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/intraday_price\" dofollow=\"true\">HAS Price</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\">YCharts</a></p> <p>The sell-off can be blamed on lower-than-expected growth in the Boys segment. The 4% YoY growth was a marked deceleration from Q1's 24% YoY growth, but this sort of sequential comparison ignores Q2's difficult comp. The company was comping against a Q2 last year that featured both an <em>Avengers</em> movie and the<em> Jurassic World</em> movie. Management commented on the conference call they saw a \"significant\" <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3193736-hasbro-down-sharply-on-concerns-over-boys-sales-growth\">slowdown</a> in <em>Jurassic World</em>-related sales from a year ago, and this shows in the disappointing 4% growth rate.</p> <p>To us, this seems rational and expected. The farther out consumers get from the release of a movie, the less those consumers are interested in purchasing toys relevant to that movie. This year, Q2 featured a <em>Captain America</em> movie, but not much else to help the Boys comp. With <em>Jurassic World</em> sales down significantly, that means all <em>other</em> Boys' sales were <em>up</em> significantly to generate 4% sum growth.</p> <p>The bigger concern here revolves around the fact that HAS will not benefit from another dinosaur catalyst. The company's partnership with <em>Jurassic Park/Jurassic World</em> ends in 2017, so investors should not expect another dino-size bump in sales. This might not be such bad news, as recent headlines suggest a <em>Jurassic World</em> sequel is delayed at best and could be canceled at worst due to disputes between the <a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/3316596/jurassic-world-2-cancelled-as-chris-pratt-walked-out/\" rel=\"nofollow\">movie's lead actor and actress</a>.</p> <p>Ex-Jurassic World, the long-term growth story remains quite<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> strong. We maintain the thesis that 2017 will be a banner year for the company. The company will benefit from a terrific movie lineup geared at re-igniting Boys' sales growth. That line up includes a third </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Cars</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie, a fifth </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Pirates of the Caribbean</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie, a second </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Guardians of the Galaxy</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie, </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars Episode 8</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, and another </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Transformers</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie. Meanwhile, we predict strong Girls' sales in 2018, driven by three TBA Disney (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">DIS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) princess movies as well as a fourth installment of the </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toy Story</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> series. Even farther out, </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> and a new </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Incredibles</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie will spark 2019 sales.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our full model can be seen below. We think continued strong momentum in the princess business will drive upside to FY 2016 estimates. We also think strong growth in the Boys business will drive upside to Fy17 estimates. We like it when we see upside to consensus estimates as we think successive earnings beats support a long-term growth story here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/29037705-1468887241289579_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"736\" data-height=\"553\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/29037705-1468887241289579.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The post-2014 HAS stock with strong partner brands trades around 21.5x LTM earnings, on average. A 21.5x multiple on our FY 16E EPS implies a price target just shy of $90. That is around a 13% return ex-dividends in about 6 months. Throw in a 2.5% forward dividend yield, and we think investors are looking at healthy, above-market returns with HAS over the next several months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/saupload_8aace839b7988db015c5a48b8c6e0dee.png\" alt=\"HAS PE Ratio (&lt;a href=\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/pe_ratio\" dofollow=\"true\">HAS PE Ratio (TTM)</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\">YCharts</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The quarter had some troubling footnotes, namely slower-than-expected Boys' growth, but those troubles are near-term-oriented and have little impact on the long-term growth story. By most metrics, it was a terrific quarter, yet the stock has sold off. This gives investors a good opportunity to buy into a high-growth, wide-moat company with earnings-related upside catalysts. We anticipate a return over the next 6 months of around 15%.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: Get In Cheap For A Long-Term Growth Story. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3989263-hasbro-get-in-cheap-for-long-term-growth-story?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "73185", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "176058", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "170405", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3989263-hasbro-get-in-cheap-for-long-term-growth-story", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3989263-hasbro-get-in-cheap-for-long-term-growth-story", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/saupload_587f9f74bbc81eae5e491df8886babba.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/7/18/saupload_587f9f74bbc81eae5e491df8886babba.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "73185", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "l-f-capital-management", "userId": 29037705, "tagId": 170405, "bio": "<p>L&F Capital Management, LLC, is a quantitative investment management group located in San Diego, California.
