Hasbro's recent purchase of animation studio Boulder Media, which also does work for Disney, seems to indicate the toymaker has plans to move into the media space. That could potentially create competition between the two companies, which certainly complicates their existing business relationship - Hasbro makes toys, lots of them, for Disney. It's too early to tell how Hasbro's latest move will shake out for the toymaker and the House of Mouse, but Cheddar thinks Disney investors should definitely keep a close eye on future developments. Disney reports earnings today.</p> <p>Check out today's video for more details:</p> <p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcheddar%2Fvideos%2F1685350151785716%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Can Hasbro compete with Disney in the media space?

I originally joined Seeking Alpha as a Senior Editor in June 2012, and left to pursue other opportunities in late 2016. During my initial tenure at SA, I managed the Dividends, Income & Retirement and Expert Insight platforms. D&I focuses on income investment strategies and dividend investment-focused content for investors from the accumulation stage to retirement. The purpose of Expert Insight is to expand and elevate the quality of Seeking Alpha's content by including articles from an industry insider's point of view, designed to help investors make more informed decisions as they consider specific sectors and trends within those sectors for their investing strategies, e.g., utilities or technology. Expert Insight articles offer more of a macro, 30,000-foot-view that goes beyond investment analysis or stock recommendations. I also curated the Dividends & Income Digest, a bi-weekly publication that takes a look at a question that is compelling and relevant to the community, showcases the responses of DI thought leaders, and serves as a round-up of top DI articles. I have a particular interest in retirement-related content, particularly with regard to using a dividend strategy to create a steady income stream for those golden years. <br></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static1.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/003/275/341/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static1.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/003/275/341/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static1.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/003/275/341/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static1.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/003/275/341/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": null, "deactivated": true, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2012, "followersCount": 1915}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "3275341", "type": "user"}}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/robyn-conti", "profileUrl": "/user/3275341", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "86", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dis", "name": "DIS", "company": "The Walt Disney Company", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "50", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/DIS"}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "569019", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "cheddar-tv", "name": "Cheddar TV", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/cheddar-tv"}}, {"id": "50491", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "robyn-conti", "name": "Robyn Conti", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/robyn-conti"}}, {"id": "1302", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "editors-picks", "name": "Editors' Picks", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::SpecialType"}, "links": {"self": "/listing/editors-picks"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "9082", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-submit", "name": "SA Submit", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-submit"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}]}
