It is likely that the trend will continue in the coming weeks, and shoppers will spend staggering $91.6 billion in online sales by the end of holiday season. Thus, a robust holiday shopping season will enable the U.S. toy industry to end 2016 on a high note with an above-average sales growth for the third straight year.</p> <p>Due to an impressive performance in the past few years, Hasbro Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>), the second largest toymaker and owner of several popular toy brands, has significantly outperformed the broader market, as well as its rival toymaker Mattel Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>). Hasbro is benefiting from the thriving U.S. toy industry. Hasbro has recorded an impressive 14% increase in top-line during the first nine months of 2016 and a further boost from the holiday season could help Hasbro achieve $5 billion sales mark for the first time in its history.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_ZqCtNSULeeBWSFgQvzS1lWt-JD9Uvo9ecYd5Zv-pbDbtwdtdvH3tgssAVXg-YSNV9e8n97g-Wh0FeDMK7G6u5la5w8UWeJKYMLHb7-xr8QGFQS5Ms2soRgdFPJHCWgIjaLAvpWlV.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"878\" data-height=\"321\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_ZqCtNSULeeBWSFgQvzS1lWt-JD9Uvo9ecYd5Zv-pbDbtwdtdvH3tgssAVXg-YSNV9e8n97g-Wh0FeDMK7G6u5la5w8UWeJKYMLHb7-xr8QGFQS5Ms2soRgdFPJHCWgIjaLAvpWlV_thumb1.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"234\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ycharts</a></p> <p><strong>A SlowDown Ahead?</strong></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2016/toys-tied-to-experiences-family-time-and-healthy-living-propel-industry-growth-through-the-holiday-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPD Group</a> estimates that toy sales growth rate will drop to 6.5% in the full fiscal year 2016, as compared to 6.7% growth in 2015. The industry-wide growth rates may slow down further next year, but the robust performance from brands like Nerf guns and Pie Face game, closer ties with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and Transformers movie will help Hasbro do more heavy lifting in 2017.</p> <p>Hasbro is well-positioned to grow sales during the Christmas holiday season and the first quarter of 2017 with the release of 3 new Nerf guns, Moana doll, Doctor Strange and Star Wars: Rogue One action figures. On the other hand, a whole new line of toys based on Disney properties, including Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Tales, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Star Wars: Episode VIII, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok will build growth momentum in the last three-quarters of 2017. Furthermore, rights to Cars 3 toy lineup will give Hasbro a key to adequately compete against Mattel's Hot Wheels brand.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To support sales growth of existing and new lines of toys, Hasbro has increased advertising spending by 11% this year. Hasbro has already committed to invest at least 10% of its total revenue on advertisements and marketing initiatives. Thus, the continued investments in marketing the new brands in the future will help maintain earnings growth rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's franchised brand Transformers will be another solid growth catalyst in 2017 and beyond due to the release of three new movies over the next three years in partnership with other film studios. Transformers series is highly profitable with an <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=transformers.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">average worldwide grossing of $943 million</a>, and I'm expecting a similar performance from the next three films - particularly from outside the U.S. The release of Transformers: The Last Knight and related toys will boost the sales of boys segment in the coming quarters, which has recorded 8% sales growth in first nine months of 2016. The growth momentum in the international markets will accelerate because Transformers are very popular in the foreign markets. In addition to that, the director Michael Bay is also building <a href=\"https://collider.com/transformers-vr-experience-micahel-bay/#star-wars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transformers VR experience</a> in collaboration with IMAX and ILM. Although this venture is in early stages, the early adaptation of developing AR/VR trends in the entertainment industry will bode well for Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The intense competition from Mattel and The Lego Group has dampened the growth of Hasbro's franchised brands in the recent past. The company needs more innovative and entertainment-related toys to grow the sales performance of its franchised brands. The preschool segment sales have remained flat in the first three-quarters of 2016. Hasbro's performance in this category is disappointing considering more than 3% growth in Infant/Toddlers/Preschool toy market between January and September 2016. The birth rate has inched in the past few years and demand for preschool toys will remain intact. Thus, Hasbro should sharpen its focus on innovation, experience, and product quality of toys in the preschool segment to improve the sales performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The digital games industry is rapidly growing, and Hasbro is actively working on new innovative ideas to boost activity engagement across multiple digital platforms. The release of Play-Doh touch app and the Play-Dog Touch Shape to Life Studio for the iPhone and iPad will bridge the gap between the interactive physical and digital play experience. On the other hand, the introduction of My Little Pony: Puzzle Party and <a href=\"https://newsroom.hasbro.com/mediakit/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=997469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DragonVale World</a>, which is the second episode of its popular DragonVale crossing 40 million downloads on the Android and iOS, will enable Hasbro benefit from continued growth in mobile games marketplace. Furthermore, in partnership with Kabam, Hasbro is releasing a promising RPG game <a href=\"https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/12/hasbro-and-kabam-announce-transformers-forged-to-fight-watch-the-trailer-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transformers: Forged to Fight</a> for mobile in Spring 2017. Hasbro can also leverage Transformers VR experience to strengthen its expertise in AR/VR mobile games in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_LUExPnwbXpspXVn-gQde90MI3PR4T_ZbUDnSwr-M2S5bum3M1SlOF5p7QbDjkK1pNfGv9gUG-Vb5UZL5W9atQmmfCL452Yn832vNYCzSBClTqECnPf32uM5nCeZl67PBMhqFzfNB.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"801\" data-height=\"504\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_LUExPnwbXpspXVn-gQde90MI3PR4T_ZbUDnSwr-M2S5bum3M1SlOF5p7QbDjkK1pNfGv9gUG-Vb5UZL5W9atQmmfCL452Yn832vNYCzSBClTqECnPf32uM5nCeZl67PBMhqFzfNB_thumb1.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-99-6-billion-2016-mobile-generating-37/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newzoo</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Still Worth Holding</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Besides increasing investments in marketing to enhance the brand appeal, Hasbro consistently increases cash return to the shareholders. Due to stable earnings and cash flows growth, Hasbro has raised the dividends at a CAGR of 16% over the past ten years. Hasbro currently pays an annualized dividend per share of $2.04, which translates into a reasonable dividend yield of 2.4%. The payout ratio of 49% based on consensus earnings per share estimate of $4.14 for the full fiscal year 2016 means there is a lot of room available for double-digit dividend growth in the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_HxsYyNagCAwFvSVX2b5lU9MTvRlIrqTE6EjnP5ovGlZoL-9-ItpzAFvNsoLGob8SHqZfcX1AJWKReO7Lb_Arsep6yqm8uoL6k-JCL1HXrJ2-M_t0kuHPOzEQke4-_ZjUFUWkMjtf.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"818\" data-height=\"295\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/6/saupload_HxsYyNagCAwFvSVX2b5lU9MTvRlIrqTE6EjnP5ovGlZoL-9-ItpzAFvNsoLGob8SHqZfcX1AJWKReO7Lb_Arsep6yqm8uoL6k-JCL1HXrJ2-M_t0kuHPOzEQke4-_ZjUFUWkMjtf_thumb1.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"231\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/has/earnings-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASDAQ</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts expect that Hasbro's bottom-line growth will slow down a bit in 2018, but still, an average 11% growth in earnings per share over three years period will be sufficient for the double-digit increase in future dividends. There is a significant gap between Hasbro's gross and operating margins. Thus, some initiatives to control operating expenses can fuel operating margin and net income, which could translate into an attractive upside potential. Although Hasbro looks fairly valued at a forward price to earnings multiple of 18.6x, it is still a decent stock to hold for the long-term gains due to a robust portfolio of brands and double-digit expected increase in earnings over the next several years.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Is Worth Holding In 2017.
