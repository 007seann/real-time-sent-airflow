As you know Hasbro is one of the three toy companies that I like to trade when the fundamentals set up properly, in addition to <strong>Mattel</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" target=\"_blank\">MAT</a>) and <strong>JAKKS</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" target=\"_blank\">JAKK</a>). Many of these names are event driven stocks that can be traded, but every now and again a so-called 'toy-cycle' presents itself where new products are released year-after-year piggybacking on successful movies or other entertainment related venues. I have said it before and I will say it again. All three toy companies have been good stocks to own and trade over the last few years. We know toy companies have moved away from traditional toys and board games into more interactive products. The traditional toy industry is still kicking, but technology like electronic/computer-based toys, apps and complex interactive toys are now extremely popular. But where to invest?.</p> <p>Now, in terms of making an investment in the space I will say that Relative to JAKKS and Mattel, Hasbro is the least expensive when it comes to current valuation. This is an important place to start. Hasbro trades at 23 times earnings, whereas Mattel trades at 31 times earnings, but JAKKS has seen losing quarters (negative earnings). I still contend that unless one of the companies has an incredibly lucrative deal in place, they tend to trade in a similar fashion, chart-wise. Many of the companies are near their 52 week highs, but still, the fundamentals matter.</p> <p>That said, what can we expect looking ahead? I think Hasbro is about to go on sale as here in the premarket it looks like the stock is heading lower as Hasbro <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3193646-hasbro-beats-0_02-beats-on-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">has just announced</a> its most recent earnings report and it reveals some clues about the consumer and threats to the company, but also provides<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> a basis for where the sector may be heading. I never expect much out of the second quarter. It's pretty slow to be honest. To my surprise this quarter was actually rather strong, at least on the headline numbers. It delivered a strong top line and bottom line beat versus analyst estimates. Net revenues for Hasbro's Q1 2016 were 10% higher year-over-year. Revenues were $878.9 million beating estimates by a strong $20 million.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, as I have discussed in most articles this earnings season, the strong dollar has been a major issue for many domestic companies with international sales. It has, of course, impacted Hasbro which does a lot of international businesses. So if we look at revenues on a constant dollar basis, it would back out a $17.7 million impact. In this case, net revenues were actually up 12%. That is incredible strength in sales. Net earnings for the quarter were up an incredible 25%. They came in at $52.1 million or $0.41 per share, compared to $41.8 million or $0.33 per share last year. This is a solid improvement year-over-year. As a whole earnings beat by $0.02.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So sales continue to be pretty strong and the company is managing expenses leading to strong earnings. Digging a little deeper into the performance, we see that Hasbro's U.S. and Canada segment brought in net revenues of $425.9 million for the quarter compared to $385.2 million for the comparable 2015 quarter. This is an 11% increase year-over-year. There was growth in the Boys, Girls and Games product categories but saw some declines in the preschool category. The segment reported operating profit of $58 million. This is a nearly a 23% gain from the $47.1 million in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Internationally, things rebounded. As a whole, net revenues were $401 million compared to $362.8 million in the comparable 2015 quarter. There was growth in all product categories except the Games category. On a regional basis, Europe was up 23%, Latin America dipped 1%, while Asia-Pacific was down 4%. Interestingly emerging markets saw revenues jump 5%. However, the key is to look at this on a constant dollar basis. Excluding an unfavorable $17 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues in the International Segment grew 15%, increasing 24% in Europe, 11% in Latin America and was about flat in Asia. On a constant dollar basis the International Segment operating profit was $29.7 million, an increase of 17% versus 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Turning to the Entertainment and Licensing segment, this key business division saw net revenues jump 9% year-over-year. Net revenues were $51.9 million compared to $47.6 million in 2015. For the most part this was a result of growth in the Consumer Products and Digital Gaming. As such this segment saw a big increase in operating profit to $13.8 million compared to $7.4 million in 2014, an increase of 83%. Commenting on the quarter, Brian Goldner, Hasbro's president and CEO stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"quote paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>\"Hasbro's focus on building brands, telling great stories, and creating the best play experiences in toys, games, digital gaming and consumer products is driving strong consumer and retailer demand for our brands globally. The excellent execution of our team continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth, while we are investing in elevating our talent and capabilities around our Brand Blueprint. Our initiatives for the second half of the year feature innovative offerings for Hasbro Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, including newly announced products such as FURBY CONNECT and SPEAK OUT, and support for upcoming major feature films, Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and DreamWorks' Trolls.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking ahead, I continue to like the company. The company is fundamentally strong as a whole and is delivering in a somewhat tough environment. Shares are looking to decline today and that presents longer-term opportunity. The company has long been reliable. I love the shareholder-friendly nature of the company. Hasbro paid $63.9 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the quarter. The company recently its dividend 11% to $0.51 per share quarterly. On top of the nice dividend, the company also has a repurchase plan in place. Hasbro repurchased approximately 270,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $21.9 million and an average price of $81 per share. The company still has $421.5 million available in the current share repurchase authorization. The stock is a winner.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><i>Note from the author: Christopher F.
