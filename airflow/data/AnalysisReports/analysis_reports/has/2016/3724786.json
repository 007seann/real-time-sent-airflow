The stock had an excellent run in the first half of 2015, climbing steadily to $80, driven by the success of the company's franchise and partner brands. Since July, though, HAS' shares have traded mostly sideways, with the occasional dip. In the past month or so, the stock has once again seen a dip, creating what in my opinion is a good buying opportunity.</p> <p>Hasbro's shares are still up nearly 40% for the year and the gains this year have been driven primarily by strong shipments of Jurassic World brand of toys and other partner brands such as Marvel and Star Wars. Its franchise brands, which include popular preschool categories have also performed strongly across geographies. The question is whether the strong performance can continue going forward.</p> <p><strong>One Recent Concern</strong></p> <p>One of the worries lately and a possible reason for the recent pullback has been the <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/results.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance</a> of Hasbro's girls segment. Sales have been consistently falling in this segment. More worryingly, the pace of decline has also been increasing. The sales drop was 16% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Sales dropped 22% in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the pace of decline accelerated further, with sales dropping 28% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, in the third quarter, growth in the boys and preschool segment was more than <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=937130\" rel=\"nofollow\">offset</a> by declines in the games and girls segments. The girls segment accounts for a substantial portion of Hasbro's top-line. Its poor performance is a major concern. But the girls segment could see a revival next year. This is because the segment will have global rights to market Walt Disney Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) 'Frozen' and 'Princess' properties. Hasbro, which has been traditionally weak in the girls segment against rivals like Mattel - known for<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Barbie and American Girl brands, is expected to generate millions of dollars in sales annually thanks to its partnership with Disney.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Top-Line Growth to be Driven by Star Wars</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The reason I believe Hasbro's shares can continue with their trajectory is because the company's sales growth is likely to accelerate in the coming quarters, driven partly by Star Wars brand of toys. The demand for Star Wars toys has been so strong that retailers have been compelled to devote more shelf space to Star War toys at the expense of other properties, according to Peter Cunio, Chairman of Iconix Brand Group Inc., a brand management company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At its Investor Day recently, Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2015/11/hasbro-playing-catch-up-sales-star-wars-toys-1201625273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> that sales of Star Wars brand of toys have been \"running ahead of expectations.\" In fact, sales have reached a point where \"inventory has been light.\" The film itself actually comes out in December. So one can expect demand to remain strong going forward. But the Star Wars brand of toys is also being seen as a long-term growth driver. CEO Goldner noted at the Investor Day that there will be more Star Wars entertainment over the next five years compared to what we have seen in the last three decades and this will reignite a fan base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/27/39529246-1448626324850423-Dushyant-Arora.jpeg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Not surprisingly, expectations are quite high. The Wall Street Journal, citing Oppenheimer, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-toys-the-force-is-with-star-wars-1447628509?alg=y&amp;cb=logged0.27432151790708303\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> earlier that sales of Star Wars toys could generate $2 billion in the last four months of this year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Driven by the strong performance of Star Wars brand of toys and a potential rebound in the girls segment sales, Hasbro's sales growth in the coming year is expected to accelerate. Analysts currently <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=HAS+Analyst+Estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\">expect</a> Hasbro's sales in 2016 to increase by almost 7% to $4.65 billion. This compares to anticipated sales growth of 1.60% for 2015. Hasbro is currently trading at 2x 2016 sales forecast. The multiple had been around 2.3x earlier this year. If the multiple once again moves closer to 2.3x, then Hasbro's shares could reach $87, which represents an upside of almost 15% from current levels.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Star Wars To Drive Hasbro's Sales Growth. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3724786-star-wars-to-drive-hasbros-sales-growth?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "86036", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "502066", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3724786-star-wars-to-drive-hasbros-sales-growth", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3724786-star-wars-to-drive-hasbros-sales-growth", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/27/39529246-1448626324850423-Dushyant-Arora.jpeg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/27/39529246-1448626324850423-Dushyant-Arora.jpeg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "86036", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "dushyant-arora", "userId": 39529246, "tagId": 502066, "bio": "I have a background in international trade-consulting and market research.
