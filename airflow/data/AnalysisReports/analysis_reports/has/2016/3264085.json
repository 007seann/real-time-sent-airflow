Many investors group these two together, not spending the time to evaluate their differences, but simply thinking of them as \"old industry\" losers in what is now a digital age of children entertainment.</p> <p>Let's start by understanding the background of each company.</p> <p><strong>Hasbro</strong></p> <p>Founded in 1923, Hasbro was originally known as Hassenfeld Brothers after the namesake founders - Henry, Hillel and Herman Hassenfeld. From simple beginnings in Rhode Island as a textile company, Hasbro has grown to become one of the largest global toy manufacturers. Some of their most memorable concepts include Cabbage Patch Kids, G.I. Joe, Furby, Mr. Potato Head and Monopoly.</p> <p><strong>Mattel</strong></p> <p>A young company in comparison to Hasbro, Mattel was founded in California in 1945 to sell picture frames and later dollhouse furniture. Mattel struck gold when they introduced the Barbie in 1959 and followed it up with other notable products like Hot Wheels and Fischer-Price baby toys.</p> <p><strong>Sales Geography</strong></p> <p>Both companies have a very similar level of total revenue and also the geographic mix - half US/North America and half International.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/6/15/17625342-14344133372237415-Virginia-Value-Investor_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/6/15/17625342-14344133372237415-Virginia-Value-Investor.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p><em>Source: Hasbro and Mattel annual reports</em></p> <p><strong>Sales by Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Looking at the sales by toy type or target audience is a little more difficult since the companies report with different segments. The chart below displays sales as reported by Hasbro and is an estimate for Mattel based on some simple assumptions. For example, we make a few gender assumptions about toys - that girls prefer playing with Barbie and boys prefer playing with Hot Wheels.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/6/15/17625342-14344139333759084-Virginia-Value-Investor_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/6/15/17625342-14344139333759084-Virginia-Value-Investor.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p><em>Source: Hasbro and Mattel</em></p>", "twitContent": "$MAT $HAS - Hasbro Vs.
