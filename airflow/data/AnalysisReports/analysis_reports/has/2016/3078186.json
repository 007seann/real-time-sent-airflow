Heading into earnings, some investors are likely kicking around what to do with the company's shares. With the<span> stock having just touched a fresh 52-week high, some investors may think that there's still plenty of upside left, but with shares trading fairly high, is it possible that the company's upside moving forward is more limited than most market participants might think?</span></p> <p><b>Analysts have low expectations</b></p> <p>For the quarter, analysts expect Hasbro to report revenue of $661.45 million. If this forecast comes to fruition, it will represent an almost 3% decline in sales compared to the $679.45 million management reported the same quarter a year earlier. While the toy manufacturer will likely fare well in its Boys and Girls categories, any decline will likely be driven by the business' Games and Preschool operations, both of which reported lower sales between Hasbro's 2013 and 2014 fiscal years.</p> <p>Looking at earnings, the picture is even worse. For the quarter, analysts expect Hasbro to report earnings per share of $0.08, which would represent a 43% decline compared to the $0.14 the company reported during the first quarter of its 2014 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, a drop in earnings will likely be attributable to a combination of lower sales and the margin-contracting effects associated with reduced volume, as well as increased royalties and selling, distribution and administrative expenses in relation to revenue.</p> <p><b>But this looks like a divergence</b></p> <p>Over the past few years, revenue and earnings for Hasbro have been rather volatile but the overall trend has been positive. Between 2010 and 2014, for instance, the company saw its revenue rise about 7% from $4 billion to $4.28 billion. This was driven entirely by Hasbro's<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> International segment, which saw revenue climb by nearly 30% from $1.56 billion to $2.02 billion, while its U.S. and Canada segment saw sales fall 12% from $2.30 billion to $2.02 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Matters also have been positive for Hasbro on an earnings front. Over the same five-year period, the company saw its net income rise by 5% from $397.75 million to $415.93 million. Despite benefiting from a growth in revenue and improvements in its cost structure with regard to its cost of goods sold and advertising, the business was negatively impacted by its royalty expenses, which rose from 6.2% of sales to 7.1%, by its product development costs, which rose from 5% of sales to 5.2% and by its selling, distribution and administrative expenses, which popped up from 19.5% of sales to 20.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the company's income statement has been mediocre over the years, its balance sheet appears quite strong. Using fiscal 2014 data, the business has a current ratio of 2.53, which means that, for every $1 in liabilities due within the next year, the company has $2.53 in cash or assets that will likely be converted into cash during this time frame. Its long-term debt/equity ratio also isn't bad at 1.06 but when you add back the value of Hasbro's treasury stock to the equation, this drops to just 0.16, which is about as good as you can get.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now that we have an idea of how Hasbro has behaved fundamentally, it's pretty clear that this drop analysts are expecting isn't necessarily terrible. Over the years, the company's top and bottom (mostly top) lines have been fairly volatile but the company is, overall, a stalwart with a healthy balance sheet. This suggests that, even if its results are poor, its long-term potential is likely to remain unchanged. However, just because the business is stable does not mean that it's an ideal play for every investor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Shares look pricey</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Currently, buying up shares in Hasbro isn't for the weak of heart. While the company itself is in pretty decent shape, its income statement could be better. This is, of course, something that investors can be comfortable with if they are buying shares on the cheap, but this doesn't appear to be the case. Using 2014's metrics, shares of the toy manufacturer are trading at 19.2 times earnings. This implies that, if profits remain unchanged forever (something that's incredibly unlikely to happen) investors wouldn't make their money back from owning its stock for more than 19 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another way to look at this is through the lens of free cash flow. Unlike net income, free cash flow looks at a company's cash as it comes in (after accounting for capital expenditure outflows). This allows investors to set aside accrual-related events that have been recognized but not yet realized. Utilizing this method, however, yields an even higher multiple of 23.4. Just as in the case of net income, this means that investors will not make their money back from owning Hasbro's stock for a period of over 23 years, ceteris paribus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Takeaway</b></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moving forward, it will be interesting to see what transpires with Hasbro. Currently, the company is doing alright but investors seem to think that its results in the upcoming quarter will be lackluster. Even if this is the case, the business has, historically speaking, been rather volatile, which means investors probably shouldn't worry too much. This is especially true when you consider that the toy manufacturer has a strong balance sheet but this does not mean investors should buy. With shares trading at very high multiples for a company posting mediocre growth, it's possible that the company is being overvalued by Mr. Market.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Investors Should Remain Cautious Of Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3078186-investors-should-remain-cautious-of-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "My name is Dan Jones.
