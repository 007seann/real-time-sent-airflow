The movie met with lackluster box office sales, clocking in at a mere $2.3 million and representing 45% of a shoestring $5 million budget, according to Box Office Mojo. This compares to the performance of the last Transformers movie <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em>, which raked in $1.1 billion at the box office and exceeded its budget by 400%. Let's take a closer look.</p> <p><strong>Didn't hold true to the original</strong></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/jem-and-the-holograms-film-review-1201623589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">review</a> by Variety's Geoff Berkshire gave indication that the movie didn't hold true to the original cartoon series. He stated that, \"Similarities between the live-action and animated 'Jem' pretty much begin and end with character names\". With that said, the Transformers live action films, which experienced huge <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3606706-5-things-to-consider-investing-in-hasbro\">blockbuster</a> success, retained a number of the original elements of its 1980s cartoon heritage to which older consumers such as myself can relate.</p> <p>The review by Mr. Berkshire also indicated that the micro budget for the film really presented itself in the form of \"low-energy affairs\" staged in front of a small number of extras meant to make the audience believe there were a huge number of fans. Also, the review noted a lack of high energy musicals that were commonly present in the 1980s cartoon version. <em>Jem and the Holograms</em> experienced a reduced presence in theaters after merely two weeks. In summary, the movie bombed big time.</p> <p><strong>How does this affect Hasbro?</strong></p> <p>It's unclear how this will affect Hasbro's top and bottom lines. It will most likely make small dent in Hasbro's girls' segment. Moreover, this gives indication that not every movie based on a Hasbro product line will be a huge success. Some movies simply will not turn out well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, Hasbro has other things going for it. The company recently decided to come out with four new Transformers' films. Moreover, Hasbro operates under a license to sell Walt Disney's (NYSE: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) <em>Star Wars'</em> toys, which have exceeded Hasbro's highest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2932486-highlights-from-hasbros-investor-day-presentation\">expectations</a> and are expected to have a bright future over the next five years. However, Walt Disney leveraged its position as content originator and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2951666-disney-ratchets-up-royalty-rate-on-star-wars-products\">increased</a> its royalty to \"about double the normal rate\" on licensing partners such as Hasbro. This could put a dampener on Hasbro's top and bottom benefit from the <em>Star Wars</em> extravaganza.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The story isn't over yet</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There exists a small possibility that <em>Jem and the</em> <em>Holograms</em> could find new life in the streaming and DVD realm. The company that originally distributed the movie, Universal, a subsidiary of media giant Comcast (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMCSA\" title=\"Comcast Corporation\">CMCSA</a>), will release the movie on DVD and on demand video in January 2016. Sometimes a movie like this will morph into a sleeper hit. Realistically, this remains highly unlikely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro still possesses many product lines that it can turn into movies. It can do more G.I. Joe movies that could even crossover into the Transformers' universe. The upcoming <em>Monopoly</em> movie could perform well. The <em>Star Wars'</em> product line could still bode well for Hasbro despite increases in royalty rates. Finally, I think long-term Hasbro shareholders have nothing to fear from the <em>Jem and the Holog</em><em>rams</em> flop.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - No, Not All Hasbro Based Movies Are Destined For Greatness. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3728246-no-not-all-hasbro-based-movies-are-destined-for-greatness?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "86", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3728246-no-not-all-hasbro-based-movies-are-destined-for-greatness", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3728246-no-not-all-hasbro-based-movies-are-destined-for-greatness", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "86", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dis", "name": "DIS", "company": "The Walt Disney Company", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/DIS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
