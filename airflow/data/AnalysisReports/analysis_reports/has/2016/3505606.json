No doubt this is part of the company's \"Brand Blueprint\" strategy in an effort to provide immersive entertainment and storytelling experiences for the consumers of its products. Creating motion pictures based on Hasbro's products has served the company well in boosting the sales of the targeted product line. The most notable example include the <em>Transformers</em> blockbuster movies and to a lesser extent <em>Battleship</em>. If history holds up, the <em>Monopoly</em> movie will do the same thing for Hasbro's board game. Here's why.</p> <p><strong>Movie will create brand affinity for Monopoly</strong></p> <p>A well-crafted <em>Monopoly</em> movie will create a story that the audience can identify with. The story will augment the <em>Monopoly</em> brand in the minds of the consumers, compelling them to purchase the board game. Playing the game will make consumers feel like they belong in the story. There is a historical precedent. In 2012, the release of <em>Battleship</em> provided an interesting story where a Naval vessel had to do battle with alien forces. The movie did exceed its budget, but wasn't a <em>Transformers</em> level hit. However, in 2012 Hasbro's games segment increased 2% year-over-year, aided in part by sales of the <em>Battleship</em> game.</p> <p><strong>Getting the right talent for the job</strong></p> <p>Turning a board game into a compelling story that the audience can identify with will take a creative leader with an interesting imagination. Hasbro and its studio partner, Lionsgate Entertainment (NYSE: LGF), brought aboard Andrew Niccol to write <em>Monopoly's</em> script. According to Hasbro's press release, he created the worlds behind <em>The Truman Show</em> and <em>The Terminal</em>. <em>The Truman Show</em> is a story about an individual who realized that his life is a television show. <em>The Terminal</em> is about an immigrant</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - 'Monopoly' Will Most Likely Boost The Sales Of Hasbro'S Board Game. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3505606-monopoly-will-likely-boost-sales-of-hasbros-board-game?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3505606-monopoly-will-likely-boost-sales-of-hasbros-board-game", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3505606-monopoly-will-likely-boost-sales-of-hasbros-board-game", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
