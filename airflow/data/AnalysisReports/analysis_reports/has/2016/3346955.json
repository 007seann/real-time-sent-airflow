As expected, strengthening dollar continued to be a drag on topline growth. However, on currency-neutral basis, Hasbro continued to show growth. Both earnings and revenue topped Wall Street's expectations. Highlight for the quarter was a 14% growth in the preschool product category, which was aided by strong demand for Jurassic World merchandises.</p> <p>I have been bullish on Hasbro for quite some time now. As I discussed before (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3280635-hasbro-set-for-sustained-top-line-growth\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3108646-hasbro-well-positioned-for-sustained-growth\">here</a>), Hasbro has a well-defined brand blueprint strategy in place. It allows the company to gain customers' insight and act accordingly in a timely manner. Effective execution of the brand blueprint strategy has allowed Hasbro to build a powerful portfolio of franchise and partner Brands, which in turn is helping it to consistently post a topline growth. In the fiscal second quarter, five out of seven Franchise Brands showed growth. In the last quarter all seven Franchise Brands had shown growth, year-over-year.</p> <p>Moreover, a solid portfolio of brands has also meant that the company does not have to rely on any particular brand for growth. For instance, during the second quarter, sales of its Franchise Brand-Transformers-weakened due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. In the same period of last year, shipments of Transformers were robust due to the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction.</p> <p>However, weakness in Transformers toys were offset by strong sales of other Franchise Brands such as NERF and Play-Doh, even as Partner brands-- Marvel, Star Wars and Jurassic World-- recorded robust shipments.</p> <p>During the earnings call, Hasbro's chairman, president and CEO, Brian Goldner said, \"Our second quarter results continue a strong start to the year with good underlying momentum in our Franchise and Partner brands across geographies,\" and added, \"We are well positioned for the remainder of 2015, but importantly we continue to develop our capabilities<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> for the long-term execution of our strategy toward unlocking the full potential value of our brands.\"</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I have no doubt that Hasbro will be able to sustain the momentum, looking ahead. While sales of Jurassic World brand of toys are expected to fuel the topline growth in the second half of the year, Hasbro's strategic partnership with Walt Disney Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) should ensure that it remains on course for further growth in 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro extended its strategic merchandising agreement with Walt Disney Company last year. The agreement allows the toymaker to sell Disney's entertainment properties -- Star Wars and Marvel's action heroes -- till 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens is scheduled to make theatrical release in December, while 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series will continue with two more releases next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Besides, starting next year, Hasbro will have global <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=872386\" rel=\"nofollow\">rights</a> from Walt Disney to develop and market toys based on Disney Princess and Frozen Properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The toymaker has already started making initial R&amp;D related investments for Disney Princess. Also in October, Hasbro's own production: Jem and Holograms-- is slated to hit theaters. A good number of scheduled film releases in the near-future from partner studios should ensure a solid demand for Hasbro's licensed toys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Piper Jaffray's Stephanie Wissink recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/20/us-hasbro-results-idUSKCN0PU0YQ20150720\" rel=\"nofollow\">predicted</a> Hasbro's annual sales could rise by 10% in 2016 even as Wall Street's analysts' consensus forecast if for 8.6% growth.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nonetheless, Hasbro needs to improve its performance in the Girl's product category. In the second quarter, sales in this category plunged 22%, year-over-year, following a 16% decline in the previous quarter. Year-to-date, sales in the Girl's Category are down 19%. Hopefully, Hasbro's strategic partnership with Walt Disney, which would allow it to develop dolls based on Disney Princess stories from the beginning of 2016, help reverse this trend.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Robust Demand For Preschool Products Boost Hasbro's Q2 Results. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3346955-robust-demand-for-preschool-products-boost-hasbros-q2-results?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "86036", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "502066", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3346955-robust-demand-for-preschool-products-boost-hasbros-q2-results", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3346955-robust-demand-for-preschool-products-boost-hasbros-q2-results", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "86036", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "dushyant-arora", "userId": 39529246, "tagId": 502066, "bio": "I have a background in international trade-consulting and market research.
