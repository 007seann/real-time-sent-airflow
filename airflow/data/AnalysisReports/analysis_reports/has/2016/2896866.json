Though financials may indicate otherwise, investors might consider the company for a long term look with the company reporting Monday, February 9th, before market's open.</p> <p><strong>By the numbers</strong></p> <p>Hasbro is coming off the stronger half of 2014, with some leaner times ahead. But before focusing the future, let's take a look at what investors (both current and potential) can <a href=\"https://www.estimize.com/has\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">expect</a> to see Monday. With the holiday season wrapping up, it should come as no surprise that the company will be reporting stronger revenues. Though quarter-over-quarter revenues are down (in the area of -9% below Q3's $1.47 billion), year-over-year revenues are marginally up (about 5%). With analysts agreeing on the whole, Hasbro's expected $1.34 billion revenue should see investors at least comforted with the numbers.</p> <p>EPS will see a similar trend, mirroring revenue historical trends with decent accuracy. Year over year, earnings should see a boost of almost ten cents to an expected mark of $1.22 per share. Looking ahead, however, investors might need to prepare themselves for far cooler earnings, with a drop of a dollar more than likely in the first quarter of the new fiscal year.</p> <p>Annual year over year growth should be in the area of an agglutinative ten percent, not inconsiderate considering the relative hot/cold relationship \"enjoyed\" by consumer discretionary companies. With the mirroring EPS trends, expect a similar gain year over year in this metric as well.</p> <p>Stocks are (barely) <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=HAS+Interactive#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">underperforming</a> for the time being, with the current price point in the area of $55.40 a little low. The good news is that even a small beat in revenues and earning has the potential boost stocks noticeably (looking at last year's mini-beat, the stock gained almost 12 points in a similar<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> economic state).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Though RSI is a little high (in the area of 55), and perhaps due for a small slide, the company still has the opportunity to gain quick in the short term before doing so. That said, with competitor Mattel falling short of fourth quarter estimates recently, the more savvy might wait for a more sure thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The bottom line</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I mentioned earlier that Hasbro has a lot of interesting possibilities headed its way, and this remains completely true. With CEO and president Brian Goldner is slated to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/102402539?__source=yahoo%7cfinance%7cheadline%7cheadline%7cstory&amp;par=yahoo&amp;doc=102402539#.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">take over</a> for outgoing Al Verrecchia as chairman of the board this coming May, the toy company should continue to see a diversification of company projects (not limited to its recent Transformers mobile application launch). However, the Q4 report might need to come with a few future intentions from Goldner before investors comfortably flock to the stock.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Though the short term is somewhat shaky for the company, and indeed rightfully so with its market somewhat slow after the holiday season. However, Goldner's ability to broaden Hasbro from a toy company to a character-based multimedia company bodes well for 2015. </p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Is Hasbro Still Young At Heart?. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2896866-is-hasbro-still-young-at-heart?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "73315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "170625", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2896866-is-hasbro-still-young-at-heart", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2896866-is-hasbro-still-young-at-heart", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "73315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "kurt-avard", "userId": 31130405, "tagId": 170625, "bio": "Preferring to look at the big picture, Kurt is an analyst who sees sweeping market trends before they happen.
