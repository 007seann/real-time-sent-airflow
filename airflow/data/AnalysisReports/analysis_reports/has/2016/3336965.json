We are modeling for a HAS revenue beat and earnings meet Monday morning, and believe shares will pop as a result. We also believe HAS is an exceptional long-term investment, as we feel it is undervalued considering its growth potential from Star Wars, the Disney princess series, and licensing revenues from the company's core franchise brands.</p> <p>HAS experienced significant international growth MRQ, with international sales growing 20% in constant currency. Emerging markets grew 25% in constant currency. Across all geographic segments, the company benefited from partner brands tailwinds, specifically Marvel sales.</p> <p>While ostensibly it may appear that HAS is overvalued due to an earnings pop following a Q1 beat, we believe HAS actually has a relatively attractive valuation considering the company has the best growth prospects in the toy-and-game space. HAS trades at 2.26x trailing sales, while competitors JAKKS Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" title=\"JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\">JAKK</a>) and MAT trades at 0.20x and 1.42x trailing sales, respectively. The industry trades at 1.43x trailing sales. HAS also trades at 24.47x trailing earnings, while JAKK and MAT trade at 9.55x and 18.51x trailing earnings, respectively. The industry trades at 19.33x trailing earnings. On a trailing basis, HAS seems to be trading at premium multiples.</p> <p>These trailing multiples, though, evade the expansion growth story of HAS, including Star Wars growth prospects in the back-half of 2015 as well as Disney Princess growth prospects in 2016. HAS trades at 19.71x forward earnings on growth expectations of 19.90%, yielding a 1-year forward PEG of just about 1. This implies shares of HAS are fairly valued, considering future growth expectations.</p> <p>On the topline, we are modeling for Preschool revenues to be relatively flat sequentially. Preschool sales are largely<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> driven by Playskool Transformers sales. According to our informal channels check, Playskool Transformers are still very popular. On Amazon.com, a Playskool Transformers toy occupy the 6, 10, 13, and 15 spots on the </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Toys-Games-Action-Toy-Figures/zgbs/toys-and-games/2514571011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Top 20 Best Sellers</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">. We do not expect to see YoY growth in this segment, though, as Q2y14 was inorganically boosted by a Transformers motion picture release during the quarter. Revenues this quarter should be further helped by a new Transformers TV show on </span><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/new-transformers-robots-in-disguise-animated-series-coming-to-cartoon-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Cartoon Network</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">. Retained popularity of the Playskool Transformers as well as a resurgence in Play-Doh sales, though, should keep Preschool sales north of $85 million.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We are modeling for Girls revenue to be down 5% YoY, driven by My Little Pony's Season 5 premiere partially offsetting losses from Furby. My Little Pony Season 4 premiered in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_%28season_4%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">November 2013</a>, and accounted for a 19% boost to Q4Fy13 Girls revenues. MRQ, faltering Furby sales caused a 16% YoY decline. We believe My Little Pony tailwinds will partially offset Furby headwinds, and believe this offsetting will result in a 5% YoY decline in sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the Boys segment, we believe we will see a 20% sequential growth in sales driven by strong Jurassic World and Avengers <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">box-office performance</a>. Our informal channel checks on Amazon.com illustrated that Hasbro's Indominus Rex action figure had climbed to the 9th spot on the Best-Seller list, while Ant-Man and Hulk were both in the top 20. We do not believe we will see YoY growth due to the first Avengers movie debuting last summer, but we do believe the new ensemble of characters in the second Avengers movie did bring about a demand for new action figures. Given these factor, we believe we will see a marginal downtick YoY in revenues, but still believe the Boys segment will perform very strong behind partner brand sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe Games will be flat YoY, as we believe we saw Franchise brands Monopoly and Magic experience peak growth in Q1, and do not believe that level of demand continued throughout Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These assumptions lead us to a Q2 revenue projection of $796.6 million, above the consensus estimate and just shy of the high-end of the range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We are modeling for a gross margin of 63%, a slight fall-off from Q1's 65% gross margin but still a YoY improvement and within management guidance. We are also modeling for product development to be 5.025% of topline, ads to be 10% of topline, intangible amortization to be roughly $11 million for the quarter, program production costs to be roughly flat YoY, and for SG&amp;A to be just over 29% of topline. All of these assumptions are in-line with management guidance, with most assuming the midpoint when a range is given.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We expect royalty expenses to be 7.75% for the quarter, up from management guidance for 7.2%. We believe royalty expenses will be higher than guided due to the extreme success of Jurassic World and Avengers, as well as pre-release excitement for Ant-Man.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Using a management guided 27% tax rate and a 124.48 million share count, we arrive at EPS of $0.29, in-line with analyst estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/19/29037705-143733604379214-L-F-Capital-Management.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given the growth prospects of this company in the back-half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of 2016, we believe a revenue beat and earnings meet on Monday will send shares higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We do not believe that Hasbro's current valuation appropriately accounts for the stock's upside from Star Wars and the Disney princess series. Star Wars is set to be released in December 2015, making Star Wars action figures and accessories the ideal Christmas gift. Boys sales should soar. Additionally, Hasbro should make a Star War Episode VII Monopoly game, which we believe would sell exceptionally well as a Christmas gift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Also, there are talks of a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2015/04/play-doh-live-action-feature-paul-feig-fox-hasbro-1201403854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play-Doh movie</a> as well as a new <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/monopoly-movie-moves-lionsgate-806201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monopoly movie</a>, which is exceptional for HAS. One major upside of HAS is the company's ability to leverage the popularity its Franchise brands to create movies and TV series, generating high-margin licensing revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All of these upside catalysts are not accounted for in a 20x forward earnings multiple, considering much-more-limited competitors MAT and JAKK trade at 16x and 11x forward earnings, respectively.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As such, we believe shares will pop tomorrow, and will continue to grow into 2016.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Undervalued Heading Into Earnings. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3336965-hasbro-undervalued-heading-into-earnings?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "73185", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "159016", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "170405", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3336965-hasbro-undervalued-heading-into-earnings", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3336965-hasbro-undervalued-heading-into-earnings", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/19/29037705-143733604379214-L-F-Capital-Management.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/19/29037705-143733604379214-L-F-Capital-Management.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "73185", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "l-f-capital-management", "userId": 29037705, "tagId": 170405, "bio": "<p>L&F Capital Management, LLC, is a quantitative investment management group located in San Diego, California.
