It has the rights for Star Wars and Jurassic World toys, and its Fur Real Friends continue to sell well to delight most children, while Monopoly is a long-term favorite for many young adults.</p> <p>David Van Knapp just wrote an excellent article about Hasbro, <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/nausvof\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. He included FAST graphs and plenty of wonderful charts. I hope you go and read this quality article. His decision is to HOLD on and let it run. I disagree, but only a little bit. He calls his price appreciation a 2 bagger, so I'll call mine a 2.4 bagger, having bought it for $33 sometime in 2012. The price is now $79+ with it having been $83-4 last week, which is bordering on excessive overvaluation, but maybe not just too stratospheric.</p> <p>It is not a big holding for me, being now only 1.4% of the total portfolio of 70 stocks and 5.3% of my consumer sector of 21 stocks. This trim lowers it now to a more equal weight within that sector for me.</p> <p>Now, as to the dividend yield, David and I agree that its continuous decline is very much a concern. Currently 2.32%, it is way way down from the 4.2% when I purchased it in 2012. This is extremely disappointing for me, considering the stock price appreciation and nice earnings.</p> <p>Future earnings estimates on Fast Graphs are showing a nice bump of 18% for 2016. Has the stock price gotten ahead of these earnings and will the dividend also get that bump? These are the questions I have been asking myself. I might be thinking too hard, but I don't think so.</p> <p>David and I also agree the CAGR is definitely decreasing and remains<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> at a 1-year somewhat pleasing 7% for 2015 (dividend of 43c \u2192 46c). Remember the 19-year CAGR was 17+% , so why are they not rewarding shareholders with the dividend as done in the past? Just me thinking again, probably too hard. By the way, this is now a Chowder # of 9.3 in 2015. It has decreased from 15+ just 3 years ago. (Chowder # is the dividend yield + the CAGR)</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With 2015 earnings of $3.38 per share and using a normal P/E of 18.5, which I got from FAST graphs, I calculated the price of $62.50 for those earnings, since earnings x P/E = price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>Morningstar suggests the fair value is $68 and a forward P/E of 20.4. Using the same $3.38 earnings x 20.4 gives me a future price of 68.95. This all depends if<span> <span>Morningstar </span>is right about the new P/E (which is still lower than the current PE of 24.2). To me, this suggests overvaluation.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Again, from<span> <span>Morningstar,</span> the 200-day ma is 63.93 and the 50-day ma is 75.27, which is definitely showing the price trend heading up. The current price of $79 is ~15% higher than the <span><span>Morningstar fair value of $68.</span></span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Value Line rates HAS a 2 for safety, B++ financially but has a 3-5 year out quote price of $55-75. Total appreciation potential of -25 to 5%. Hmmm, are they right? I repeat: (Minus) -25% to 5% total appreciation. I am not appreciating that. I didn't want to chance it and decided to sell 10% of my holdings, taking capital gains in my Roth. That seems strange for such a nice performer, but I get uneasy when something begins to look too good. The position is now 1.4% of my total portfolio of 70 stocks and 5.3% of my consumer sector holdings of 21 stocks. This was larger than most in my consumer sector, and thus will not be missed. I am watching Hasbro and wonder if it will pay a nice dividend or just become a growth stock\u2026 thinking again, I am. If anyone wishes to sell, please note the next Ex-date is July 30. If you do sell before that, you would lose the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Mattel (NYSE: <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a></span>) is a much different story. It has been just plain disappointing. This one I should have seen the price decline coming. I pretty much thought Mattel had it made with Barbie. I think they thought the same, because not much has happened with them acquiring new or interesting toys. I bought MAT for $38 in 2013. It has become a 2.4 bagger for me on the minus side if I sell. <span><span>Morningstar gives FV of $29. Value Line has a target price of $35-45 for 3-5 years out. That does offer some hope, but not much. That was the good news for me on price. Now, the bad news: Fast Graphs shows adjusted estimated future earnings growth of -15.6% and future estimated earnings at $1.55. Current P/E is 16.3. <span><span>Morningstar is suggesting a forward P/E of 14.3. Uh-oh! That is lower than it is now.</span></span></span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Using that <span><span>Morningstar forward P/E of 14.3, the price x future estimated earnings of $1.55 would give us a wonderful future price of: ta da... $22.17 for 2016. To me this stock is not undervalued, it is at a very deserved price. I am not loving that news... the CAGR is even worse. CAGR is very much in decline, being 19 for 3 year, 6 for 1 year and ZERO now. It is in a dividend freeze\u2026 the next announcement might be a cut. The biggest plus side to MAT is the BIG FAT Yield of 6.55% at a price of $23.21. I bought mine with a 4.0% yield, so I am not getting that kind of return. It looks like their FFO could cover the dividend for awhile. Next year does look a bit better, but at the best, expect the same dividend for a few years. FAST graphs is showing the same estimated dividend for 2016 and a 1c raise in 2017. Are they right? I know what the worst could be, so I will be ready. If it maintains the dividend, this could even be a BUY, if you like to speculate. Don't do it now, just wait and see if they can make that dividend. It has an August 24 ex-date, but I would still wait even longer to decide. This definitely is not a stock to buy right now thinking the current dividend is in any way SAFE or reliable. They are paying the 38c per quarter dividend since Feb 2014. Can it continue, I ask myself, and that is what has influenced my decision. I sold 100% of MAT in a taxable account to get the capital loss for 2015 (30% of my holdings). It is now 1.1% of my portfolio and 4.25% of my consumer stocks. I have kept the rest, and I am now going to SPECULATE by keeping MAT on the back porch right over the trap door. If they cut the dividend, or if there's any rumblings they might, I will SELL all of it. I have also decided if it gets a price spike for some reason, that would be a nice signal to sell some or all as well. I would love to get some good news from them to help keep them in good standing. Blending with my desire to lower my consumer sector stock holdings, these actions should be a good plan for my portfolio.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Do you have a MAT or HAS toy story to share?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Would you buy MAT, not knowing if it will keep the dividend?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Am I wise to wait and continue to capture the dividend with hope in my heart?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Would you just sit on your cap gains in HAS and watch the CAGR?
