This translated into a total return of 373% for shareholders vs. 123% for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole (see charts below). At the heart of Hasbro's success is its Brand Blueprint. Let's take a look at the proverbial planetary core of what drives Hasbro.<img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/saupload_751b5134c159328a85cf2a6eb50fa644.png\" alt=\"HAS Revenue (&lt;a href=\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/revenues_ttm\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">HAS Revenue (NYSE:</a>TTM) data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/saupload_cd9da117a0c638b6e7aa8bcd71abcd81.png\" alt=\"HAS Total Return Price Chart\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/total_return_price\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">HAS Total Return Price</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></p> <p><strong>Mapping out customer loyalty</strong></p> <p>In the digital age toys are increasingly competing with other forms of entertainment such as online and mobile gaming. Also toys are viewed as old school. Hasbro, to figure out a way to combat the decline in the obsolescence of toy play, decided to transform the company from a vanilla wafer toy and game manufacturer into a branded toy franchise venture which resulted in mapping out its Brand Blueprint (image below).</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/6009511-14315575269194086-William-Bias_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/6009511-14315575269194086-William-Bias.jpeg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p><em>Source: Hasbro Investor Relations</em></p> <p>The immersive entertainment experiences and storytelling component represents the most important aspect of the Brand Blueprint. When customers are immersed in the stories surrounding their favorite toys, such as Transformers, G.I. Joe and My Little Pony, brand loyalty ensues among the children and adults who remember earlier stories from their childhood.</p> <p><strong>Brand loyalty translates into purchases</strong></p> <p>Children who are loyal to their fictional heroes and heroines urge their parents to buy the toys, online games, and clothes with Hasbro brand images attached, so they can be part of the stories seen on television or in the movie theater. Some adults see the stories and brand imagery which reminds them of their childhood affiliations with company products, compelling them to buy Hasbro merchandise for themselves as well. Moreover, stories and sagas leave consumers wanting to know what happens next which entails the introduction<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> or reintroduction of old characters giving the story and its products a fresh new start in the life cycle.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The story telling component definitely drives revenues. According to Hasbro's latest annual report, story driven toys grew 7% per annum from 2012 to 2014. By comparison non-story driven toys remained flat during that time period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Introducing the world to the Hasbro epic</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another part of Hasbro's Brand Blueprint is having global exposure. Moreover, the company realizes its future lies in getting products into areas of the world with low market penetration. Emerging markets contain a growing middle class that can enjoy the stories surrounding Hasbro's brands. Hasbro's revenue in Asia grew 17% year-over-year in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3083146-hasbro-has-brian-d-goldner-on-q1-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">most recent quarter</a> vs. a decline of 6% in the more mature European markets. In another example, <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> garnered 78% of its box office receipts from sources outside the United States, according to Box Office Mojo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What does this mean for investors?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Brand Blueprint represents a solid long-term strategy for Hasbro's business. Consumers will continue to buy Hasbro's products as long as there are compelling stories surrounding its brands. Developing captivating stories surrounding its brands remains a high priority for the company. Hasbro's senior management is already working on a My Little Pony movie which should be released by 2017 according to IMDb. Hasbro is also in a state of deep thought surrounding its most popular brand in the last ten years: Transformers. Hasbro executives <a href=\"https://www.dayherald.com/transformers-5-akira-goldman-leads-the-writers-team-paramount-planning-a-crossover/2117/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hired</a> a lot of writers for the next Transformers movie and there is speculation that there will be a Transformers Cinematic Universe or a Transformers official story canon that should enhance its storytelling draw. Sci-fi consumers love consistency in storytelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think Hasbro will remain a compelling long-term investment as long as it continues to follow the Brand Blueprint. Investors are going to pay up for shares of this high quality company. Currently, the company trades at a P/E ratio of 22 vs. 19 for the S&amp;P 500, according to Morningstar, making it somewhat overvalued. Investors may want to take a small position and enjoy the company's 2.6% dividend yield while adding more shares during corrections.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - The Brand Blueprint: The Core Of Hasbro's Success. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3182366-the-brand-blueprint-the-core-of-hasbros-success?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3182366-the-brand-blueprint-the-core-of-hasbros-success", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3182366-the-brand-blueprint-the-core-of-hasbros-success", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/saupload_751b5134c159328a85cf2a6eb50fa644.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/13/saupload_751b5134c159328a85cf2a6eb50fa644.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
