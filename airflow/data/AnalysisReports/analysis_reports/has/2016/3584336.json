All three have been good stocks to own over the last few years, but in many cases, they are better for traders. Generally speaking, catalysts that drive these stocks higher come in one of two forms. The first is a very strong consumer that drive sales, particularly during the holiday season, or as has been the case most recently, when these companies have a favorable licensing agreement in place that capitalizes on toy deals for popular movies. Once in a while a standalone toy or game turns out to be a home-run, but as time goes on, these companies rely on children and their desire for toys. </p> <p>Interestingly, we have seen the companies move away from traditional toys and board games into more interactive products. In many cases, these are electronic/computer-based toys, or other complex products. The key, however, is recognizing that demand will ebb and flow, as will the strength of the consumer. Picking your spots in these names is the key.</p> <p>In this article, I will cover Hasbro, specifically honing in on its most recent performance and trading fundamentals. Relative to JAKKS and Mattel, Hasbro is not the most expensive when it comes to current valuation. This is an important place to start. Hasbro trades at 22 times earnings, whereas Mattel trades at 19 times earnings, but JAKKS trades at 25 times earnings. But I contend that unless one of the companies has an incredibly lucrative deal in place, they tend to trade in a similar fashion, chart-wise. </p> <p>That said, is pain ahead?
