But it also markets under many more beloved brands such as: Littlest Pet Shop, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, and Play-Doh.</p> <p>Hasbro is not just a toy story, it's a brand story.

Its game and puzzle business also reported a 7% rise in revenues. And the preschool category saw revenue growth of 22%, thanks to the Play-Doh and Playskool Heroes brands. Despite the strong dollar, international and emerging market demand was quite strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The growth story at Hasbro is not its physical toy sales, but the rapid expansion of its <a href=\"https://valuentumbrian.tumblr.com/post/116917039850/why-hasbro-is-one-of-our-top-ideas\" rel=\"nofollow\">high-margin</a> Entertainment and Licensing revenues. The company's Entertainment and Licensing business now represents 30% of its operating profits. In particular, the licensing revenues for My Little Pony and Transformers were particularly robust.

And it just got more expensive on the surprise upside results. But the company's growth prospects are underestimated at only 10.7%. Therefore, it receives a Value Grade of D+. But as mentioned, the stock pays a nice dividend of almost 3%, which pays investors to stick around as the growth story \"Transformation\" kicks in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/21/928334-14296561352429464-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" height=\"521\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Data from Best Stocks Now app)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Whereas investors used to view Hasbro as just a physical toy story in a digital age, that perception has changed as the power of the licensing and brand franchise is being recognized. The stock has gained more than 25% over the last year. And before the recent upside move, the stock was already up 21% YTD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/21/928334-14296561601799936-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" height=\"496\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Data from Best Stocks Now app)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Out of the 4000+ stocks in the Gunderson Best Stocks Now universe, Hasbro stock ranks #121.
