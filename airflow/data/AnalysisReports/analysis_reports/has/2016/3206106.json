We think there's any number of stories to be told, that's a brand that's been around for 30 years with amazing canon and mythology. And we would expect the sequel to Transformer movie to happen in 2017.</p></blockquote> <p>The media has thrown this quote around conjecturing that Hasbro is planning a \"cinematic universe\" in which all of its stories, such as television shows, comic books, novels and games, are interconnected in a fictitious universe that provides continuity and consistency in storytelling. While this quote doesn't explicitly say that this will happen, I can understand how the media can read into this and think that Hasbro will follow in the footsteps of Paramount's Star Trek and Walt Disney's (NYSE: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) Marvel and Star Wars universes. Hasbro could certainly fortify the storytelling and immersive entertainment components of its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3182366-the-brand-blueprint-the-core-of-hasbros-success\">Brand Blueprint</a> strategy. Let's take a look at how a cinematic universe could help Hasbro and its investors.</p> <p><strong>Continuity serves as a draw</strong></p> <p>In April, Marvel released the highly acclaimed <em>Daredevil</em> series on Netflix (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>). I really liked Daredevil. I found Matt Murdock's <em>good</em>, squaring off with the <em>evil</em> that is Wilson Fisk, quite refreshing in a day and age where Sci-Fi good and evil commonly get blurred. However, as a Walt Disney shareholder, I took note of something else\u2026the characters in the <em>Daredevil</em> series kept referring to a \"battle of<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> New York\", which turns out to be a reference to the first </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Avengers</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> movie.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This got the wheels turning in my head, and I began wondering if <em>Daredevil</em> characters will make guest appearances in the next <em>Avengers</em> movie? What about <em>Marvel's Agents of Shield</em>? There are murmurings about how <em>Daredevil</em> is a stepping stone towards <em>The Defender</em>s, a movie that I and millions of others (hopefully) will spend good money to see. And, hopefully, consumers will buy related toys and comic books for themselves and their families.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The same thing could happen with Hasbro's highly popular Transformers' saga. Transformer fans could watch a television show that focuses on one aspect of the universe, such as a G.I Joe live action TV series, and then go to the movies to follow up. Meanwhile, children (and adults) could buy toys to act out the overall storyline from multiple product lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Bringing consistency to the Hasbro Universe</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has always been good at recycling its product lines with every new generation. Unfortunately, with every new reincarnation comes a slightly new, but separate, storyline. I always thought this represented a weakness in Hasbro's strategy and approach. It made it hard for die hard and loyal fans to keep track of all the various reincarnations of storylines. A cinematic universe could bring a sense of continuity to the sagas. There are even suggestions in the media that maybe Hasbro could cross G.I. Joe into the Transformers Universe. It has been done in the comic book world with G.I Joe vs. Transformers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This will make it harder for Hasbro to recycle product lines over time. However, the recycling could be written into the stories. A fictitious universe is only limited by the human imagination, where characters and their corresponding toys can be created and crossed over into other parts of the universe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>How does this help Hasbro's investors?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Having consistency in storytelling can serve as a strong qualitative catalyst for Hasbro's fundamentals over the long-term. In an age where kids are increasingly being entertained through digital means, it's important for Hasbro to build a loyal brand following in an effort to sell its toys and games. Story related products have proven to perform better within Hasbro's product portfolio. Consumers who consume story content know that if something is going on in the background, they will investigate. What they will find is another aspect of the universe, complete with new characters and toys that will enhance Hasbro's top and bottom lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am a long-term owner of Hasbro's shares. Currently, the company trades at a P/E ratio of 23 vs. 19 for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, meaning that it's not too exorbitantly overvalued. Interested investors may want to take a small position, while adding shares during downturns. Also, investors can enjoy a 2.6% dividend yield while waiting for Hasbro's new strategies to come to fruition.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - A Cinematic Universe Could Bode Well For Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3206106-a-cinematic-universe-could-bode-well-for-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3206106-a-cinematic-universe-could-bode-well-for-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3206106-a-cinematic-universe-could-bode-well-for-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
