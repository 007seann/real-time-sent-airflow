Moreover, fiscal first quarters are traditionally low-revenue quarters for Hasbro, so shipments should pick-up pace going forward.</p> <p>Last year as well Hasbro's shipments benefited from the release of two significant motion pictures during the summer months: The Amazing Spider Man 2 and Transformers: Age of Extinction.</p> <p>In the current fiscal year, Hasbro already has been to a decent start.

This brand blueprint, which focuses on understanding consumer and audience insight, enables it to quickly adapt to changes in the market. Robust shipments of its Franchise brands prove Hasbro's effective brand-building strategy is yielding results.</p> <p>Additionally, the toymaker is also expected to benefit from a few more significant releases lined-up this year that are spread across the broader period of a time unlike last year when releases were timed during the summer.</p> <p>Following the Avengers: Age of Ultron and Jurassic World release, there</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Set For Sustained Top-Line Growth. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3280635-hasbro-set-for-sustained-top-line-growth?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "86036", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "502066", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3280635-hasbro-set-for-sustained-top-line-growth", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3280635-hasbro-set-for-sustained-top-line-growth", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "86036", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "dushyant-arora", "userId": 39529246, "tagId": 502066, "bio": "I have a background in international trade-consulting and market research.
