As a shareholder of the company, I like to contemplate and research how movies surrounding the company's product lines will augment sales. I think the company is off to a great start in developing a <em>Play-Doh</em> movie. Here's why.</p> <p><strong>Story, story, story</strong></p> <p>In the brick-and-mortar retailing world, it's about location, location, location. In the movie world, it's about story, story, story. In order for this movie to be successful, it will need to be compelling for a broad audience. Moreover, this certainly provides opportunity for using the Play-Doh product in the form of Claymation. This will certainly augment the brand in the minds of the consumer. Hasbro executives gave indication in its first-quarter earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3083146-hasbro-has-brian-d-goldner-on-q1-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=5&amp;p=qanda&amp;l=last\">call</a> that it's developing characters that audiences will love and that the company can utilize for years.</p> <p>Personally, I would like to see Hasbro take a page from the <em>The Lego Movie</em> playbook, which incorporated its own franchise characters. Hasbro could pull from its Transformers and G.I. Joe universes, along with including new, original characters that it may be developing. This could go along with the cinematic universe currently under development at Hasbro. Perhaps, it could take the form of a satire of other characters. This is where the writers and director of choice come in.</p> <p><strong>Director muscle</strong></p> <p>Paul Feig is <a href=\"https://www.geek.com/news/after-ghostbusters-paul-feig-will-make-a-play-doh-movie-1619685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">supposed</a> to be directing the <em>Play-Doh</em> movie after he completes the latest <em>Ghostbusters</em> installment. <em>The Play-Doh</em> movie could utilize Hasbro's cast of characters for semi-serious drama and satirical character references. Paul Feig's experience in directing comedies should help create a compelling but funny story for the audience at large. A compelling storyline will help<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> fulfill Hasbro's ultimate goal of selling more Play-Doh products to global consumers. If Hasbro plays its cards right it can augment the sales of products other than Play-Doh.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Global expansion of product</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro declared Sept. 16 as a global Play-Doh holiday, serving as an indication of management's desire to expand the product line globally. The movie will certainly add to the global appeal given a good enough story. Hasbro executives feel that a Play-Doh movie will appeal to global audiences based on market reception in China. History serves as an indication that the movie will probably draw more box office receipts from outside the United States. In 2014, roughly 77% of the box office receipts for the blockbuster film <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> came from outside the United States, according to the website Box Office Mojo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given a compelling story, Hasbro can leverage the Play-Doh movie in many ways based on its brand blueprint strategy. Consumers \"immersed\" in the movie experience will want to go out and buy Play-Doh products as well as other products if utilized in the film. Hasbro may also reap benefits from the release of related games and clothing. Hopefully, all of this effort will pay off in the form of revenue and free cash flow growth for Hasbro and ultimately dividend increases and capital gains for its shareholders.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Here's How A Play-Doh Movie Could Work For Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3541896-how-play-doh-movie-work-for-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3541896-how-play-doh-movie-work-for-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3541896-how-play-doh-movie-work-for-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
