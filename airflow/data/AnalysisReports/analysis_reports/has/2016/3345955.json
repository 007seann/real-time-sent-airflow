Hasbro, realizing its strengths, stated in a press release that it will \"Focus on Global Brand Building\". Here's what this may mean for Hasbro's shareholders.</p> <p><strong>Hasbro zeroing in on its strengths</strong></p> <p>This move sends a signal to the investing public that Hasbro's strength lies less in the actual manufacturing of toys and games and more on storytelling and branding. Apparently, manufacturing has become an annoying distraction to Hasbro's focus on its success DNA. As I have said <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3331205-hasbro-understands-its-recipe-for-success\">before</a>, stories breathe life into an otherwise inanimate object such as toys. This represents the best hope of competing with other forms of entertainment provided by video games and tablets. Hasbro hopes, by focusing on content, that it can increase its sales and free cash flow at a faster clip.</p> <p><strong>Should enhance return on equity</strong></p> <p>Selling its manufacturing facilities not only raises cash for Hasbro to invest in content development, but it makes Hasbro an \"asset light\" company. Without manufacturing assets, Hasbro doesn't possess as much equipment that it can depreciate, serving as a drag on its net income. It should also have less capital expenditures to replace plant assets, serving as a drag on free cash flow.</p> <p>Also, this increases the company's return on equity, which already resides at a ten year high of 26% (see chart below). This also means it will take fewer assets to generate even more free cash flow, which enhances the potential for higher dividends, debt pay downs and share repurchases. Moreover, it makes it easier for the company to build a cash nest egg for difficult times.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/saupload_93d84748b16dd7c3dd2ca4b3dff57bd9.png\" alt=\"HAS Return on Equity (Annual) Chart\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"yc_font\">HAS Return on Equity (Annual) data by YCharts</p> <p><strong>The downside</strong></p> <p>Under<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> the deal with Cartamundi, employees of the manufacturing facilities will continue to make board games for Hasbro. This transaction may leave Hasbro's former employees feeling insecure and disgruntled. This could conceivably translate into product quality and public relations issues down the road. This might especially prove true if Hasbro uses contract companies for all of its manufacturing needs. A hands-off approach could cause some of Hasbro's stakeholders to lose a sense of personal investment and accountability.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Hasbro's excellent year</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the most recent quarter, Hasbro <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2637495-hasbro-beats-by-0_04-beats-on-revenue\">reported</a> year-over-year growth of 5% when factoring out foreign currency exchange translations. The company beat the Wall Street expectations game on both the revenue and earnings fronts. Feeling positive from its success momentum, Hasbro's management clearly wants to keep it going by focusing on its core competency and cash generating capabilities with this sale to Cartamundi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the long-term, the extra free cash flow stemming from this transaction should bode well for shareholders. Better fundamentals generally translate into superior shareholder gains. Unfortunately, the stock market also realizes the potential of this company, assigning it a P/E ratio of 25 vs. 19 for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, according to Morningstar. At this valuation I am a holder and not a buyer of the stock. However, I will definitely buy more during market corrections.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro De-Emphasizes Manufacturing: Here's What It Means For Shareholders. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3345955-hasbro-de-emphasizes-manufacturing-heres-what-it-means-for-shareholders?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3345955-hasbro-de-emphasizes-manufacturing-heres-what-it-means-for-shareholders", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3345955-hasbro-de-emphasizes-manufacturing-heres-what-it-means-for-shareholders", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/saupload_93d84748b16dd7c3dd2ca4b3dff57bd9.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/saupload_93d84748b16dd7c3dd2ca4b3dff57bd9.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
