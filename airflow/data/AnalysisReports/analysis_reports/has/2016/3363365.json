Its closing price Monday was $79.52, for a price gain of 108%. The position has grown to become 5% of my portfolio. The company's yield has fallen to 2.2% because of its price growth has outpaced its dividend growth.</p> <p>My business plan has this guideline (not a hard-and-fast rule) for selling stocks: I will seriously consider selling if (among other things)</p> <ul> <li>a stock \"bubbles or becomes seriously overvalued\"</li> <li>its yield drops below 2.5%</li> </ul> <p>Here is what Hasbro has done in price and yield since I bought it:</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_0.png\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>Hasbro's yield is obviously below 2.5%. Is it seriously overvalued? Let's find out by putting it through its valuation paces.</p> <p><strong>FASTGraphs Default Valuation</strong></p> <p>Step 1 is to consult FASTGraphs and see whether, at its default setting, Hasbro looks overvalued.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_1_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>The FASTGraphs default \"fair\" P/E for this stock is 15, which is the default for most dividend growth stocks. As you can see, HAS is priced 61% above its fair value by this reckoning. I would say that is serious overvaluation.</p> <p><strong>FASTGraphs Average Valuation</strong></p> <p>Step 2 is to reset the above graph to use Hasbro's own average valuation as the fair value line rather than the default setting of 15.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_2_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>This changes the picture, but not much. The stock's current price is still 43% over its fair value calculated using HAS's 18-year average P/E of 16.9 for fair valuation. I would say this still suggests serious overvaluation.</p> <p><strong>Morningstar</strong></p> <p>Step 3 is to look at Morningstar's star rating for the stock.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/223670_14380882760779_3.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p>On Morningstar's NPV system, which takes a different approach from FASTGraphs, HAS rates 2 stars on a 5-star system. I consider that overvalued, but not seriously so.</p> <p><strong>Relative Yield</strong></p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Is Hasbro Seriously Overvalued?
