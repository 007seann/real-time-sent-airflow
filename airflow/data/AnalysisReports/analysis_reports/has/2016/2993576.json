Hasbro's most recent results reveal fantastic licensing growth, and its portfolio of brands speaks to a strong recurring revenue stream. We like the company's business model a lot. Let's walk through our thesis on the shares.</p> <p><strong>Hasbro's Investment Considerations</strong></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257892430027502-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p><strong>Investment Highlights</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Hasbro's products include toys/games, television programming, motion pictures, and digital gaming. The firm owns well-known brands such as Transformers, Nerf, Playskool, My Little Pony, G.I. Joe, Magic: The Gathering, and Monopoly. The company was founded in 1923.</p> <p>\u2022 Though concerns over the demise of physical toys may not be completely unfounded in this digital age, Hasbro is less a toy company than it is a licensing firm. During 2014, high-margin entertainment and licensing revenue advanced 15% while this segment's operating profit leapt 30%+.</p> <p>\u2022 Hasbro is focused on re-igniting its world-class portfolio of brands. The company is targeting long-term revenue CAGR of 5%, operating profit to exceed revenue expansion, and operating cash flow to average roughly $500 million annually. The firm recently announced intentions to buy back a significant amount of stock.</p> <p>\u2022 Hasbro's new strategic merchandizing relationship with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) Consumer Products for the Disney Princess and Frozen properties is a huge win, and we expect the company to benefit from the relationship for years to come.</p> <p>\u2022 We're big fans of Hasbro's dividend growth potential. The company has been paying dividends since 1977, so its track record is fantastic. Dividend increases are on<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> the horizon. Our snapshot of the company's dividend health is shown below.

In our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. We think business returns and stock market returns are correlated over the long haul.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 39.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. We assign the firm a ValueCreation\u2122 rating of EXCELLENT as a result. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257894885692904-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257895029034247-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Cash Flow Analysis</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257895196823046-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Cash flow represents the core of any valuation analysis. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Hasbro's free cash flow margin has averaged about 10.7% during the past 3 years. We think the firm's cash flow generation is STRONG as a result. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Hasbro, cash flow from operations increased about 48% from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures expanded about 13% over the same time period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation Analysis</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We spend most of our time digging into the firm's financial statements and deriving our best estimate of its intrinsic value. We know that any reasonable investor will never pay more for an investment than it can receive from the future cash flows of that investment. That's why we focus on discounted cash flow analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We also know that all of what is known is in the past and all of what has value is in the future. But the future has yet to be written. Even if it may be uncertain, however, we can't just ignore it. Instead, we embrace this uncertainty and accept the view that valuation should be presented as a range of fair value outcomes, not a precise and immovable point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our fair value range for Hasbro's shares is $53-$79. The estimated fair value of $66 per share is modestly above the company's ~$61 per share price at the moment. In a market that seemingly makes new highs every day, finding a stock that is trading below intrinsic value is quite the reward. There looks to be an opportunity at Hasbro, as the market continues to come around to recognizing its fantastic licensing growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">More specifically, our enterprise free cash flow model, which drives the fair value estimate, reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15.6%, which is above Hasbro's trailing 3-year average. We expect the firm's entertainment and licensing segment to do most of the heavy lifting in coming years. Our near-term forecasts do not differ much from consensus estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Hasbro, we use a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257896526407526-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257896645365665-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257896836748638-Valuentum_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257896836748638-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Margin of Safety Analysis</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257897689757555-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $66 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our ValueRisk\u2122 rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Hasbro. We think the firm is attractive below $53 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $79 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As an investor, it's helpful to think in this framework, a range of probable fair value outcomes. Any research that says that a firm is worth precisely this or precisely that is <em>precisely</em> wrong. The future cash flows are what determines intrinsic worth, and the future, by definition, has yet to be written. A range-of-outcomes approach is most valid in thinking about intrinsic worth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We think the market is still in the process of recognizing Hasbro's fundamental business model shift and the implications of its high-margin entertainment and licensing stream on future expected free cash flows. We like the dividend growth gem quite a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Pro Forma Financial Statements</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257898770365415-Valuentum_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257898770365415-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em></em>)</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-1425789891174942-Valuentum_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-1425789891174942-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257899039483633-Valuentum_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257899039483633-Valuentum.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></em></p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Fundamental Business Model Shift. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2993576-hasbros-fundamental-business-model-shift?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24491", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "34650", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2993576-hasbros-fundamental-business-model-shift", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2993576-hasbros-fundamental-business-model-shift", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257892430027502-Valuentum.jpg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/7/933684-14257892430027502-Valuentum.jpg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "24491", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "valuentum", "userId": 933684, "tagId": 34650, "bio": "<p>We offer subscriptions and exclusive newsletters.
