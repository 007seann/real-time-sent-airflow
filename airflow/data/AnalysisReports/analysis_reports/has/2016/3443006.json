Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) is the nearest competitor with a market capitalization of $7.82 billion. Hasbro is behind Mattel in terms of revenue and income figures. For 2014, Hasbro reported net income of $416 million with $4,277 million revenue, while Mattel generated revenue of $6,024 million and reported net income of $499 million. However, the growth story of Hasbro is quite interesting. Hasbro has witnessed its revenue growing at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2010 and 2014 driven by strong performance of licensed toys, preschool toys and boys division. Mattel's revenue increased at a CAGR of just 0.7%, the lackluster demand for iconic Barbie brand negatively impacted Mattel's top and bottom-line. Similarly, Hasbro's diluted earnings per share CAGR of 4.0% is much better than Mattel's diluted earnings per share CAGR of -6.0%.</p> <p><b>Adopting The Change Is Fueling Growth</b></p> <p>The technological advancement and innovation across the world is also changing the outlook of the toy industry. The growing demand for electronic gadgets and gaming tools is pushing the traditional toy-makers to adopt the change. This digital transition is opening a whole new bunch of opportunities for the toy-makers. Hasbro is adopting the change and this is going so well so far for the company. The new products for 2015 include Optimus Prime Mega Step, which is a toy car that transforms into Optimus Prime character, and Iron Man Arc FX Gloves with motion-activated technology. Moreover, the Nerf N-Strike Modulus ECS-10 Blaster with additional kits option is also an example of that change.</p> <p>Despite 4% decline in sales due to strong currency headwind, Hasbro outperformed as Mattel's sales dropped 7% during the second quarter 2015. Mattel is struggling to revive its Barbie and Fisher-Price brands, but it seems that the company has failed</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - The Growth Story Justifies Hasbro's Valuation. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443006-growth-story-justifies-hasbros-valuation?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "90015", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "519695", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3443006-growth-story-justifies-hasbros-valuation", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443006-growth-story-justifies-hasbros-valuation", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "90015", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "bull-s-run", "userId": 40467095, "tagId": 519695, "bio": "Buy-side analyst having extensive knowledge and skills.", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Bull's Run", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2015, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2015, "followersCount": 696}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "40467095", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "651155", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651165", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651175", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651185", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/bull-s-run", "profileUrl": "/author/bull-s-run", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "519695", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "bull-s-run", "name": "Bull's Run", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/bull-s-run"}}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "long-ideas", "name": "Long Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=long-ideas"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
