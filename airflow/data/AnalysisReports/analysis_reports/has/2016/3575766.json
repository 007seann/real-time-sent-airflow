None of that has changed as far as the company goes, but choppy market conditions seem to warrant caution.

Debt looks troublesome, but manageable. The key for Hasbro comes down to execution, from profitable toys that kids really want to effective uses of capital.

In reality, at $80 the stock had a little too much exuberance baked in too soon. Technical conditions for the stock continue to deteriorate, and HAS sits below its 20-, and 50-day moving averages. The convergence of earnings season and weak technical conditions warrant caution, and investors should be wary of any run-up in stock price before Monday's call.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another consideration for Hasbro is valuation, and earnings estimates are only that, estimates. The toy business is tough business, especially if you don't make video games, and Hasbro faces the same challenges all toy makers face, the fickle nature of children everywhere. Wall Street may have trouble digesting these valuations if Hasbro doesn't deliver on Monday.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr><td colspan=\"3\"> </td></tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>HAS</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/E excluding extraordinary items</p></td> <td><p><strong>22.7</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/E Normalized (MRFY)</p></td> <td><p><strong>23.2</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/Sales</p></td> <td><p><strong>2.2</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/Tangible book</p></td> <td><p><strong>17.3</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p><strong>16.2</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><p>* Data above as of Oct 09, 2015</p></td></tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Long-Term Opportunities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One the plus side, Hasbro pays a nice dividend (2.5% at the current price of $73.67), and if this stock gets beaten up after earnings some nice buying opportunities might present themselves. If this happens, and that's a big if, then look for support at $67 to $68, which would put the stock right around the 200-day moving-average. Any close below that price might justify a further assessment of the earnings call, or market conditions overall. Current shareholders might consider downside protection through a covered call or other options.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Long-term Dividend Growth Investors should take a long look at Hasbro, and listen carefully to the earnings call on Monday. Historically, October instills fear into the market, and Hasbro is not immune to such over-reactions.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Update: Reasons To Be Cautious Into Earnings. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3575766-hasbro-update-reasons-to-be-cautious-earnings?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "87366", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "507976", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3575766-hasbro-update-reasons-to-be-cautious-earnings", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3575766-hasbro-update-reasons-to-be-cautious-earnings", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/14841532_14448905166581_rId8.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/14841532_14448905166581_rId8.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "87366", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "market-dj", "userId": 14841532, "tagId": 507976, "bio": "<i>Every stock has a story, and that story is told each day the stock market opens.</i><br><br><b><br></b><p><b>Market DJ: Research, Enlightenment, Entertainment</b></p><br><br><p>Listening to the market, cutting through the noise...\u00a0Finding good products & companies, crunching numbers...\u00a0Looking for long-term macro trends in consumer spending habits...\u00a0Learning through research and market performance...</p>Focusing on US Listed Companies:<br><i><br></i><i>\u2013retail and technology trends<br></i><i><br></i><i>\u2013media and entertainment products<br></i><i><br></i><i>\u2013food & beverage, restaurant, and hospitality <br></i><i><br></i><i>\u2013long & short opportunities<br></i><br><br><br><p>We conduct independent, boots on the ground research, as well as the numbers.
