It also centers on \"The Combiner Wars\" saga. I think this move means that Hasbro executives understand two of the biggest drivers of Hasbro fundamentals, and subsequent stock price, in recent memory -- brand and storytelling. Here's why.</p> <p><strong>Choice of partner</strong></p> <p>Hasbro chose an interesting partner to develop this new web series, Machinima. Interestingly, Machinima describes itself as a \"many2many programming service\" and \"most notorious purveyor and cultivator of fandom and gamer culture\". In this case I like the word \"cultivator\". These phrases left me with the impression that the website is a crowdsourced platform that involves the lovers of everything in the realm of sci-fi, fantasy, and video gaming. Machinima's newly adopted motto, \"Heroes Rise\" gives indication to this implication.</p> <p>It also tells me that the website's sci-fi/fantasy oriented users can help expand a particular brand or franchise as well as consume it. Programmers, made up of passionate fans, would truly understand what Transformers is all about and what other fans want from the series. Machinima programmers could use that passion and knowledge to create engaging content that will enhance brand loyalty and pent up demand for the next Transformers movie. Moreover, Hasbro could utilize this partner to enhance its other brands, such as G.I. Joe and Magic: The Gathering.</p> <p><strong>Storytelling</strong></p> <p>Hasbro knows that in this day and age, toys compete with tablets, mobile phones and computers. A toy by itself seems obsolete. Toys need a story behind them to remain relevant. The recent announcement highlighted adult fans and teens as target audiences further evidenced by the fact that it will deliver \"action and humor\", which were part of the appeal of the original Transformers series.
