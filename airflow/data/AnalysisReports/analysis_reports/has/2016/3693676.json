It helps that it has a better movie tie-in lineup than Mattel. Hasbro owns the licensing rights to <em>Star Wars, Transformers</em> and <em>Jurassic World</em>, and those three franchises should deliver for years to come. The first <em>Star Wars</em> sequel hits theaters this year, with two more coming over the next few years. There are four more <em>Transformers</em> movies in the works, and a <em>Jurassic World</em> sequel is tentatively scheduled for 2018. Of course, let's not forget about the upcoming <em>Frozen</em> sequel too.</p> <p>Movie tie-ins have been great revenue drivers, and Hasbro looks like it's set for a while. Mattel, on the other hand, is lacking. It has <em>Man of Steel, </em>but not much else, and even that franchise likely won't move the needle significantly. Mattel's strength was always in its line of <em>Barbie</em> products, but interest in that is beginning to wane as the Disney princesses remain strong and alternate lines like <em>Monsters High </em>gain popularity.</p> <p>Which brings us to the dividend. On the surface, Mattel's 6% dividend looks like a better deal, but it's starting to reach the point of unsustainability. Hasbro's dividend, on the other hand, has a number of revenue drivers behind and looks secure.</p> <p>Mattel and Hasbro retained similar dividend payout ratios as recently as last year. Both were around 60%, but since then, they've diverged greatly. Hasbro now sports a payout ratio of under 50%, while Mattel's has skyrocketed to 170% on a trailing 12-month basis.</p> <p><img
