Hasbro is engaged in providing leisure time products with a portfolio of brands and entertainment properties ranging from Transformers to Monopoly and My Little Pony. On April 20, 2015, the company reported first quarter earnings of $0.21 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.13. In the past year, the company's stock is up 42.68% and is beating the S&amp;P 500, which has gained 4.58% in the same time frame.</p> <p>Hasbro has definitely been the beneficiary of Disney's line of characters of late and the latter recently announced that it was going to have <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2015/07/07/disney-to-roll-out-playmation-demos-in-stores.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in-store demos</a> of the Playmation toy line that the former helped develop. It was this bit of news that made me want to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth adding shares of the company right now for my portfolio.</p> <p><strong>Fundamentals</strong></p> <p>The company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 24.13, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 19.47 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.21), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 19.93%. The company has great near-term future<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 19.93%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.6%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Financials</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.38% with a payout ratio of 58% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 9.4%, 28%, and 15.5%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 2.38% yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being. The company has been increasing its dividends for the past 12 years at a 5-year dividend growth rate of 16.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Technicals</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/6808631_14367149855463_rId7.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/6808631_14367149855463_rId7_thumb.jpg\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span>Looking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock is approaching overbought territory with a current value of 61.51. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars flattening in height which tells me bullish momentum may be coming to an end in the name. As for the stock price itself ($77.22), I'm looking at $82.46 to act as resistance and $75.08 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -2.77% to 6.79%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Wrap Up</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential with great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. Financially the company pays a decent dividend and has decent financial efficiency ratios. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Though on a technical basis the stock appears to have more upside than downside I don't believe I'll be buying additional shares anytime soon. I'm taking this stance because the stock appears to be near overbought territory. I must admit that I made a mistake by closing my position in the name back in early 2014 at $54. The stock stagnated during 2014 as I thought it would but has skyrocketed during 2015. The fundamentals have changed significantly from last year and I think there is more upside to come in the name going forward but I can't justify buying more shares above the $63.46 level. I've selected that price because it is the midway point of the 52-week range and I feel at that price it represents value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>My Take: Hold</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.
