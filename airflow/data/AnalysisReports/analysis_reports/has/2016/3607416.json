But in order to understand the company in a more simple way, let's just say it sells entertainment (mostly toys) to four different segments: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool. Its revenues are well diversified among those four sectors:</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId8.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/897899913x0x478557/48615F4C-B665-40EC-B5AC-447FAC08A38A/Hasbro_Investor_Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hasbro Investors Presentation</a></p> <p>Hasbro has been able to show stronger revenue growth compared to the world's largest toy maker, Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), for a very good reason:</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId10.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId10_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: Ycharts</p> <p>Hasbro has been very proactive with an aggressive expansion strategy initiated in 2006, with its first licensing agreement with Marvel. This was the beginning of a new era for the company. Since then, it has performed very well through licensing agreements with other major players in the toy industry. In 2009, Hasbro signed with Sesame Street and entered into a major strategic partnership with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) in 2014 for Disney's Princess, Frozen and Descendants brands. The Holiday season will be quite busy as well with the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> coming of the first movie of the new Star Wars Trilogy: The Force Awakens.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the company has done well with licensing others products, it hasn't lost focus of its \"home brands\". In fact, only 20% of Hasbro's revenue came from partner's brands in 2014 (source Hasbro website). The company showed revenue increases for 6 of its 7 top brands so far in 2015 (Magic, Monopoly, Nerf, Play-Doh, Little Pony and Littlest Petshop). The only Hasbro brand showing a slowdown is Transformers as its latest movies were in 2014 and the company expected a slowdown in toy sales. However, there is a new Transformers movie expected in 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you look back at the previous graph, you will notice sales are pretty much flat since 2012. This has been caused by two factors: the first one is linked to currency headwinds. Hasbro released its most recent quarter in October, showing a 9% sales increase in neutral currency. This is very strong considering a relatively weak global economy. The second reason why sales aren't growing that much is Americans didn't spend as much as expected in the past two years. Most consumers have rather put money aside or paid off debts instead of buying more goods. Overall, this is not a bad thing, but it didn't help Hasbro's revenue trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking forward, Hasbro has proven to the world that even though kids play on their iPads, they continue to enjoy a good game of Monopoly or making war plans with their Nerf Guns. Boys and Preschool segments are the most promising, with Q3 YOY sales increases of 24% and 17%, respectively. Games show an 8% decrease and the Girls segment is more concerning with a decrease of 28%. The addition of Disney Princess and Frozen toys will definitely help this segment in the year to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividend Growth Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a dividend investor, I obviously focus on the distribution outlook of any company. I've gathered some important key metrics in the following graph:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId11.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId11_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As you can see, the dividend growth is impressive over the past 10 years, and the company was able to maintain a respectable payout ratio. Now that earnings have jumped in the latest quarters, the payout ratio is back under 50%. I personally don't expect the company to continue increasing its payout by a double-digit number, but a high single digit seems more appropriate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sales are in a very good position to increase due to the upcoming release of several blockbusters and a new partner agreement with Disney. Along with sales growth, earnings should continue to beat analysts' estimates and generate more room for future dividend growth. It is now a main focus for capital allocation, and management has clearly established that dividend increases will remain within HAS' priorities. No wonder Hasbro is part of my <a href=\"https://www.thedividendguyblog.com/2015/10/19/10-dividend-growth-stocks-for-a-rock-solid-portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Top 10 Dividend Growth Stocks</strong></a> at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company makes it very clear in all its investor presentations that it focuses on sharing the wealth with its shareholders. In addition to constantly increasing its dividend payouts, the company is also buying back shares. After using roughly $100M per year in 2012 and 2013 to buy back shares, the company went for a big commitment in 2014, buying back $460M worth of shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Stock Valuation</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, is it the right moment to buy HAS? The answer will be found through our valuation process. The first step is to examine how the market valued the stock over the past five years looking at its PE ratio:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId12.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId12_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since 2013, you can see there is hype around the company's valuation. The stock was historically trading at lower multiples, but it now seems a bit expensive with a current PE around 21. Is it justifiable based on upcoming blockbusters generating millions in toy sales? I would rather use a second method to establish a more precise value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In order to do so, I use a double stage dividend discount model calculation. The double stage level enables me to select a first dividend growth rate for the first 10 years and a second dividend growth rate for the years after. Considering the company shows a low payout ratio (under 50%), and revenues and earnings are poised to burst due to new partner brand contracts, I expect the company to increase its dividend by 10% in the upcoming 10 years and reduce it to 7.5% afterward. Since I use a relatively aggressive dividend growth rate, I will also be quite demanding in regards to the discount rate I use. For Hasbro, I will use a 11% discount rate as I expect strong growth from the stock value.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr><td colspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Calculated Intrinsic Value OUTPUT 15-Cell Matrix</strong></p></td></tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"3\"><p><strong>Discount Rate (Horizontal)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Margin of Safety</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10.00%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11.00%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>12.00%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>20% Premium</strong></p></td> <td><p>$117.02</p></td> <td><p>$82.96</p></td> <td><p>$64.07</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>10% Premium</strong></p></td> <td><p>$107.27</p></td> <td><p>$76.05</p></td> <td><p>$58.73</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Intrinsic Value</strong></p></td> <td><p>$97.52</p></td> <td><p><strong>$69.14</strong></p></td> <td><p>$53.39</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>10% Discount</strong></p></td> <td><p>$87.77</p></td> <td><p>$62.22</p></td> <td><p>$48.05</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>20% Discount</strong></p></td> <td><p>$78.02</p></td> <td><p>$55.31</p></td> <td><p>$42.72</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://dividendmonk.com/dividend-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dividend Toolkit</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As you can see, even with an aggressive discounting rate, I get a fair value under the current market value. The recent drop in the stock price helped create a buying opportunity. If you expect HAS to return 11% in your portfolio, you just found a great entry point. I think this stock will continue to please both growth and dividend investors in the upcoming years.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I own HAS in my Dividend Stocks Rock portfolio</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Is Set For A Strong Return. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3607416-hasbro-is-set-for-strong-return?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "21151", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "164455", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "9170", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "543406", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3607416-hasbro-is-set-for-strong-return", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3607416-hasbro-is-set-for-strong-return", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId6.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/106145_14458818145546_rId6.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "21151", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "the-dividend-guy", "userId": 106145, "tagId": 9170, "bio": "My name is Mike and I\u2019m the author of The Dividend Guy Blog & The Dividend Monk along with the owner and portfolio manager here at Dividend Stocks Rock (DSR).\u00a0I earned my bachelor degree in finance-marketing, own a CFP title along with an MBA in financial services.
