It has added and honed brand-building capabilities and created brand blueprint to find growth opportunities both in domestic and international markets.</p> <p>Still, Hasbro's performance in the stock market has been a bit patchy in the recent past. Although the stock has matched the S&amp;P 500 Index in terms of returns in the last five years, the performance has been erratic. It lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index in 2011 and 2012. This was because Hasbro, as part of its brand-building strategy, was <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/82369378x0x651965/88EAC1D3-30CD-48EB-A0A5-8A6099817717/2012ar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">restructuring</a> and eliminating several historically intricate and expensive SKU making arrangements which led to a decrease in net earnings.</p> <p>The stock, however, performed exceptionally well in last two years. As I mentioned earlier, the company has charted-out a brand blueprint.</p> <p>Thanks to this brand blueprint - which was made after understanding consumer and audience insight - Hasbro is able to adapt quickly even as it experiences constant changes in retailer and consumer base throughout the world. Increased focus on franchise brands, however, is the cornerstone of this brand blueprint.</p> <p><b>Heightened Focus on Franchise Brands</b></p> <p>Although Hasbro has been focusing on global expansions for quite some time now, 2013 was the year in which it started to heighten its focus on franchise brands such as Monopoly, Nerf, Transformers, My Little Pony and many more.</p> <p>The rationale was that these global brands offer Hasbro the greatest growth potential both in terms of profits and revenues. Accordingly, Hasbro is investing more resources to further strengthen these valuable brands.</p> <p><b>Results Show That the Strategy is working</b></p> <p>In fiscal 2013, Hasbro's franchise brands <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/82369378x0x741385/E28E2FAF-2077-43D9-A860-63D242A90D00/HAS_2013_Annual_Report_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted</a> revenue growth of 15%, year-over-year, representing 44% of total revenues. Last year was even better. Revenue from franchise brands rose 31%, year-over-year, <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/82369378x0x819559/8A09F66A-4137-45A9-88BA-C16F08E1AF90/Annual_Report_Website_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">representing</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 55% of the fiscal 2014's revenues.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revenue from franchise brands increased 20%, year-over-year, in the fiscal <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/82369378x0x822014/2346B79C-B7A7-4AB3-9157-7B999B22EA0E/Hasbro_Q1_2015_Earnings_Presentation_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">first quarter</a> of 2015 as all seven brands - Littlest Pet Shop; Magic: The Gathering; Monopoly; My Little Pony; Nerf; Play-Doh; Transformers - grew, year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moreover, Hasbro is also enhancing its consumer engagement through its global digital content and innovative story telling. In fiscal 2013, 85 million consumers were engaged with Hasbro's digital experiences. Increased user engagement, in turn, helps the company to push sales of its top brands. For instance, ever since My Little Pony was re-launched in 2010 on digital platforms spanning 180 territories around the globe, sales of this brand have increased every year since 2011. In 2014, My Little Pony recorded more than $1 billion in global retail sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Likewise, Hasbro's strategy to build a portfolio of solid partner brands is also helping drive its top-line growth. Last year, it expanded its strategic merchandising relationship with the Walt Disney Company for two brands: Star Wars and Marvel. The agreement for Star Wars and Marvel extends till 2020. Beginning 2016, Hasbro will also have global rights to develop Disney Princes and Frozen Properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"Jurassic World,\" slated to be released this June, has already started to boost its sales of licensed merchandises. In the first quarter of 2015, Jurassic World licensed toys helped driving up sales by 10% in the boy segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That said; Hasbro will have to be watchful and more innovative in its traditional toys and games product category. Toys and games industry has been witnessing <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/82369378x0x822014/2346B79C-B7A7-4AB3-9157-7B999B22EA0E/Hasbro_Q1_2015_Earnings_Presentation_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing</a> pressure due to falling demand as children are switching over to mobile gaming and consumer electronic goods. In the first quarter, sales of toys in the girls category fell 16%, year-over-year. Hasbro's rival Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/04/20/hasbro-beats-street-in-1q/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> sixth straight quarterly sales decline due to falling demand for its toys. That's why focusing on digital entertainment and licensing segment becomes all the more important for Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Bottom Line</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro points out that it has gradually transformed itself from a mere toy and game company to an organization that delivers global brand experiences. Its strategic initiatives such as establishing franchise brands and partner brands along with creative digital content are delivering good results. And these will be long-term growth drivers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS trades on a P/E of 22, which is well below the industry <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=HAS+Competitors\" rel=\"nofollow\">average</a>. Based on the consensus earnings forecast of $3.27 per share, Hasbro trades at a P/E of just under 22. Importantly, Hasbro has consistently raised its dividend over the last five years as it has registered <a href=\"https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=HAS\" rel=\"nofollow\">robust</a> free cash flow growth. With a dividend yield of 2.57%, Hasbro is an attractive proposition for income investors. There is also potential for long-term capital appreciation, driven by Hasbro's strategy of strengthening its valuable brands.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro - Well Positioned For Sustained Growth. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3108646-hasbro-well-positioned-for-sustained-growth?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "86036", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "154382", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "502066", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3108646-hasbro-well-positioned-for-sustained-growth", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3108646-hasbro-well-positioned-for-sustained-growth", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "86036", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "dushyant-arora", "userId": 39529246, "tagId": 502066, "bio": "I have a background in international trade-consulting and market research.
