The strong quarter was powered by strong demand for Avengers and Jurassic World action figures, reinforcing Hasbro's upside in the back-half of the year through partner brand sales. Hasbro also saw an increased demand for Star Wars action figures, as we near the release date of the highly anticipated Star Wars Episode VII.</p> <p>We believe shares of Hasbro still have more upside, and our DCF model yields a fair value of $87 for shares of HAS. If we use the analyst consensus revenue estimate over the next 2 years, and then assume a 3% CAGR thereafter into 2020, we can see that we expect $5.3 billion in revenue by 2020. Given Hasbro's potential for revenue growth through the multitude of Disney's pipelines, as well as additional licensing revenues from the company's core Franchise Brands, we believe these revenue projections may actually be conservative.</p> <p>Net Income margin grew nearly 300 basis points last year, and we expect to see margins continue to expand as the company generates a more significant portion of its revenue from the licensing of Franchise brands. We believe net profit margin will grow steadily to roughly 11% by 2020.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/29037705-14374051905897148-L-F-Capital-Management_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/29037705-14374051905897148-L-F-Capital-Management.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>One of the most crucial aspects of Hasbro's MRQ data was that operating cash flow as more than 2x last year's 6-months-ended operating cash flow. This was due to changes in operating assets and liabilities having a net positive impact as opposed to a net negative impact. We assume that non-cash adjustments remain constant with historical data and that changes in operating assets and liabilities retain a positive impact as they have this past year. Given these assumptions, then, operating cash flow should grow relatively in line with net income.</p> <p>Capital expenditures have<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> also been unusually high this year, and we believe capex should return to its 2012-2014 levels of roughly $113 million. Using a 11% WACC discount rate and a 3% perpetuity rate, we arrive at a fair value of $87 per share for HAS.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/29037705-1437404969227673-L-F-Capital-Management_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/20/29037705-1437404969227673-L-F-Capital-Management.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Albeit a $87 fair value, we believe shares of HAS could rise much more than that due to anticipation of the new Star Wars movie as well as future installments in the Avenger series.
