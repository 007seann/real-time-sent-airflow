The company expanded its revenue and profitability at a brisk pace. Hasbro saw its revenue, net income and free cash flow expand 5%, 45% and 18% respectively.</p> <p>On the balance sheet, the company saw its cash position go from 41% of stockholders' equity in 2013 to 61% of stockholders' equity in 2014. The company possesses plenty of cash for its war chest to make strategic acquisitions and finance product innovation. However, it did take on more long-term debt. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio went from 57% in 2013 to 106% in 2014, more than twice my personal threshold of 50% (more on this later). Let's take a look to see what's driving Hasbro.</p> <p><strong>The story behind the brands</strong></p> <p>Hasbro's president and CEO summed up the results best when he said, \"These results highlight the power of building innovative brand experiences based firmly in global consumer insights and supported by compelling stories.\" Hasbro's boys segment contributed the most to the company's overall growth in 2014. Within that segment, two product categories of note - Transformers and Marvel - served as catalysts for growth.</p> <p>The underlying theme here is that having a story tied to a product line creates consumer engagement and affinity for the product. The year 2014 saw the release of <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em>, which raked in $1 billion at the box office, while raising brand awareness in the process. Movies such as <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, which saw $714 million at the box office, also raised brand awareness for Walt Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and its licensed toy products, which Hasbro sells.</p> <p><strong>Some words of caution</strong></p> <p>While Hasbro blew it out of the water on the revenue and profitability front, there were a couple of<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> downers. First, as noted above, long-term debt nearly doubled during 2014. Investors should keep an eye on Hasbro's debt appetite. However, for the time being, the company refinanced some of its old debt in Q2 FY 2014, lowering its overall interest cost. In 2014, Hasbro's times interest earned clocked in at seven times versus four times in 2013. The rule of thumb for safety lies at five times or more.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Second, the company raised its dividend, and may have compromised its sustainability. I always like to gauge dividend sustainability by comparing dividend payout to free cash flow. My personal preference is for a company to pay out less than 50% of its free cash flow in dividends. In 2014, Hasbro paid out an uncomfortable 64% of its free cash flow in dividends, versus a more tolerable 54% in 2013. This may be all well and good if the company continues to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Thoughts on the future</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro does a pretty good job on its brand renewal. For example, Transformers have been reborn time and time again since the mid-1980s. I see no reason why it can't be reborn in a major way in the future. Also, in the intermediate future, the company stands to benefit from the new Star Wars movie due out later in 2015 as a result of its license agreement with Walt Disney.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One of my concerns for Hasbro is that future generations will fall in love with characters that don't belong to Hasbro or its licensing partner Walt Disney, rendering franchise brands such as G.I. Joe or Star Wars obsolete. Also, Hasbro doesn't perform as well fundamentally in years without a blockbuster movie. Its high dividend payout and long-term debt could compromise the company and its shareholders during the lean years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to Morningstar, Hasbro trades at a P/E ratio of 21 versus 18 for the S&amp;P 500, meaning that it's not too overvalued. On a forward basis, it's actually undervalued, trading at a P/E ratio of 16 versus 17 for the S&amp;P 500. As long as the company can keep the stories fresh and maintain financial discipline, it deserves a spot in your portfolio.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Story-Driven Products Drive 2014 Results For Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2914526-story-driven-products-drive-2014-results-for-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2914526-story-driven-products-drive-2014-results-for-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2914526-story-driven-products-drive-2014-results-for-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "earnings", "name": "Earnings", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/earnings"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
