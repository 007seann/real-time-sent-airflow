Usually, what propels these names higher is one of two things. A very strong consumer that drive sales, particularly during the holiday season, or, as has been the case most recently, when these companies have a favorable licensing agreement in place that capitalizes on toy deals for popular movies. On occasion, a stand-alone product becomes a hit, but as time goes on these companies rely on children and their desire for toys. Over time, we have seen a shift from standard toys to more interactive or even electronic/computer based toys. Each of the toy companies has had its ups and downs over the years.</p> <p>In this article, I will cover Hasbro. Relative to JAKK and Mattel, Hasbro is the most 'expensive' when it comes to valuation. Hasbro trades at 26 times earnings, whereas Mattel trades at 18 times earnings, but JAKK trades at just 9.5 earnings. But I contend that unless one of the companies has an incredibly lucrative deal in place, they tend to trade in a similar fashion. Mattel has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2634375-mattel-beats-by-0_05-misses-on-revenue\">already reported an</a> earnings beat and a revenue miss. Now Hasbro is out with its earnings.</p> <p>Hasbro did pretty well and reported a strong quarter with top and bottom line beats versus analyst estimates. Net revenues for Hasbro's second quarter were actually down year-over-year. Revenues decreased 4% to $797.7 million, down from $829.3 million in 2014. However, this was better than analysts had targeted. They expected revenues to come in at $797.4 million. Now, as I have discussed in most articles this earnings season, the dollar has been an issue. So if we look at revenues on a constant dollar basis, it would back out a $7.5 million impact. In this case, net revenues were actually up 5%.
