(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) has been around since 1923, and is a company name that most parents and kids recognize. The company makes toys, and while its main competitor Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) and its <em>Barbie</em> franchise in known for its \"girl product\" focus, Hasbro is known for its more male-orientated toys, such as the <em>Transformers</em> action figure line and all things <em>Nerf</em>. But it also markets under many more beloved brands, such as: <em>Littlest Pet Shop</em>, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Monopoly</em>, <em>My Little Pony</em>, and <em>Play-Doh</em>.</p> <p>Back in April, I wrote an article about how Hasbro is not merely a toy story, but a brand story. The company is successfully leveraging its extensive brand portfolio globally and converting it into high-margin growth opportunities in its Entertainment and Licensing segment.</p> <p>On July 20th, Hasbro reported yet another blowout quarter, with earnings coming in at $0.33, versus estimates of $0.29. <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/13224544/1/hasbro-shares-surge-as-earnings-beat-estimates.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sales</a> were hurt by the strong dollar and fell 3.8%. Had it not been for the currency effect, revenues would have been up 5%. The second quarter is not usually a big quarter for toy manufacturers, but Hasbro's inventory is well positioned for the holiday season. The shares rose more than 6% on the earnings results.</p> <p>Hasbro has negotiated <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toymaker-hasbros-sales-fall-4-104528512.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">studio licensing agreements</a> for blockbuster movie franchises such as <em>Jurassic Park</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, and <em>X-Men</em>. Mattel, on the other hand, has struggled to boost sales of its iconic <em>Barbie</em> franchise. The result, over the last year Mattel has lost more than 30% this year while Hasbro has surged up more than 50%.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/928334_14376659182035_0.png\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>The recent success of <em>Jurassic World</em> and the relaunch by Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise later this year has Hasbro on pace for a record year. And competing with Mattel where it hurts, in the girl category, Hasbro also inked a deal<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> for the </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disney Princess</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> franchise. The release of the Disney movie </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Frozen</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> officially knocked </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Barbie</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> off her pedestal.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In this era of electronic toys and devices that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/072015/barbie-sends-mattel-stock-extreme-slimming-diet-mat-dis-has.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hasbro describes</a> as \"children getting older younger\", branding and strategic licensing agreements have become critical to success. And the company seems to have the brand mix that children - boys AND girls - demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So let's take a closer look at the Hasbro stock using the Best Stocks Now app.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/23/928334-14376664352983701-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Data from Best Stocks Now app</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is a mid-cap stock in the Leisure sector, with a market capitalization of $9.9 billion. Its risk profile is Moderate. The company generates annual revenues of $4.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/23/928334-14376664550435143-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Data from Best Stocks Now app</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For a toy stock, Hasbro does not look cheap with its trailing P/E of 24 and forward P/E of 20. Its Value Grade is C. But as mentioned, Hasbro is transforming itself into more of a media company, linking its future success to licensing agreements instead of the traditional toy business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/23/928334-14376665330309112-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Data from Best Stocks Now app</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investors used to view Hasbro as an old toy maker in an age of new higher-tech toys. It's the plot of <em>Toy Story</em> all over again: Woody versus Buzz. But that perception has changed, as the power of the licensing and brand franchise is being fully recognized. The stock is up almost 50% YTD, and receives a Momentum Grade of B+ and a Performance Grade of A-. Hasbro's execution is particularly impressive given the struggles of key competitors in the category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/23/928334-14376665576542404-Bill-Gunderson.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Data from Best Stocks Now app</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Out of the 4130+ stocks in the Gunderson Best Stocks Now universe, Hasbro ranks #83. Its stock grade is an A-, which gives it a Buy rating. I am long the stock.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is an underappreciated growth story. The company's core business may be toys, but its growth business is the power of its brand franchise. That is a toy story that competitors like Mattel are not understanding. Sorry Barbie, you are missing the party.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: A Tale Of 2 Toy Stories. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3354085-hasbro-a-tale-of-2-toy-stories?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "Bill Gunderson has been a professional money manager and analyst for the last 24 years.
