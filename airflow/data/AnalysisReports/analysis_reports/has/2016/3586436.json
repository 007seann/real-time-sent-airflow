Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which is the most awaited movie of this year, is the growth driving force for toy industry this year and perhaps the next year too. Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>), the second-largest toymaker, is one of the beneficiaries of licensed toys, and recently, the company beat the consensus estimated for its third quarter earnings.</p> <p>Hasbro ended the third quarter 2015 with earnings per share of $1.64, up 15% over the same period last year, while consensus had estimated $1.51 in earnings per share. Flat sales revenue, on the other hand, missed the estimate and stock price collapsed amid concerns over top-line growth. After <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/has/interactive-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">losing 10%</a> value over the past three months, Hasbro is trading at an attractive level to execute a buy as the long-term outlook of the company is intact.</p> <p><strong>Top-line Is Not That Bad</strong></p> <p>Hasbro recorded net sales revenue of $1.47 billion for the most recent quarter, almost flat. Despite that, the overall performance of Hasbro remained satisfactory as the negative impact of a strong dollar was offsetting the top-line growth throughout the quarter. Meanwhile, sales rose 9% excluding the adverse currency impact of $132.4 million. Hasbro showed impressive strengthen across its product portfolio with boys and preschool categories posting double-digit growth. However, Hasbro lagged again in girls' category and games sales also failed to add growth. Overall, net earnings for the third quarter 2015 increased to $207.6 million, up from $180.5 million in the same period last year, a jump of around 15%. Going forward, with the ease in currency headwind, the top-line of the company is expected to show further strengthen in the short as well as long-term, primarily due to Hasbro's portfolio of popular licensed toys.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: The Dip Is An Opportunity. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3586436-hasbro-dip-is-opportunity?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "90015", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "519695", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3586436-hasbro-dip-is-opportunity", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3586436-hasbro-dip-is-opportunity", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "90015", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "bull-s-run", "userId": 40467095, "tagId": 519695, "bio": "Buy-side analyst having extensive knowledge and skills.", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/040/467/095/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Bull's Run", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2015, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2015, "followersCount": 696}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "40467095", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "651155", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651165", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651175", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "651185", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/bull-s-run", "profileUrl": "/author/bull-s-run", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "519695", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "bull-s-run", "name": "Bull's Run", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/bull-s-run"}}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "long-ideas", "name": "Long Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=long-ideas"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
