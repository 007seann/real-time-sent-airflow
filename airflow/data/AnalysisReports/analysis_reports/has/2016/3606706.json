Businesses that offer a product that stands out or is unique will increase the odds that the enterprise will succeed. Success generally translates into steady or expanding free cash flow that ultimately translates into superior capital appreciation and dividend increases over the long term</p> <p>Toy company Hasbro (NASDAQ: <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>), with its story centered brand <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3182366-the-brand-blueprint-the-core-of-hasbros-success\" target=\"_blank\">blueprint</a>, managed to keep its products relevant in an age where consumers largely entertain themselves with smartphones and tablets. Let's take a look to see what keeps this company going and examine its possibilities.</p> <p><strong>The Transformers phenomenon</strong></p> <p>The <em>Transformers</em> blockbuster movies really helped put Hasbro on the map over the past eight years. Each and every one of those movies proved a huge success. The last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2596065-transformers-lead-the-way-in-hasbros-q3-2014-earnings\" target=\"_blank\">movie</a> in the saga, <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> grossed more than $1 billion in box office receipts. Seeing this huge success, Hasbro and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA) subsidiary, Paramount ordered four <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2812796-hasbro-paramount-plan-four-transformers-films\" target=\"_blank\">new</a> <em>Transformers</em> motion pictures over the next 10 years.</p> <p>Media outlets emphasized that Michael Bay may or may not direct the next film. Although, they peg <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> star Mark Wahlberg as playing a role. Honestly, I'm not sure that bringing in a previous cast and crew, both on screen and behind the camera, represents a good idea. The old regime may grow tired of doing the films and write subpar stories that could hurt the brand. It might be best to do a reboot and start the <em>Transformers</em> universe on a clean slate. As a side note, I would also like to see G.I. Joe tied to Transformers in a future film.</p> <p><strong>Star Wars will most likely fill in the gaps</strong></p> <p>In the past, Hasbro's top line didn't perform very<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> well in some years with no </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Transformers</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> blockbuster in theaters (see chart and table below). However, Hasbro possesses a license to sell some of Walt Disney's </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> merchandise, which may keep sales going between Transformers movies over the next five years. Walt Disney plans at least six new films between the end of 2015 and 2019, according to Cinemablend.com.</span></p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><p><strong>Transformer's Motion Pictures</strong></p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Movie Title</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Year of Release</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Worldwide Box Office Gross</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Transformers</p></td> <td><p>2007</p></td> <td><p>$709.7 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</p></td> <td><p>2009</p></td> <td><p>$836.3 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</p></td> <td><p>2011</p></td> <td><p>$1.123 billion</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Transformers: Age of Extinction</p></td> <td><p>2014</p></td> <td><p>$1.104 billion</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/search/?q=transformers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Box Office Mojo</em></a></p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>Hasbro Revenue (in millions)</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>2006</p></td> <td><p>2007</p></td> <td><p>2008</p></td> <td><p>2009</p></td> <td><p>2010</p></td> <td><p>2011</p></td> <td><p>2012</p></td> <td><p>2013</p></td> <td><p>2014</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>$3,151</p></td> <td><p>$3,838</p></td> <td><p>$4,022</p></td> <td><p>$4,068</p></td> <td><p>$4,002</p></td> <td><p>$4,286</p></td> <td><p>$4,089</p></td> <td><p>$4,082</p></td> <td><p>$4,277</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=HAS&amp;region=USA&amp;culture=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Morningstar</em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's Boy's segment contributed heavily to the company's success in the most recent quarter, increasing 24% year-over-year. Merchandise from the upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> film has experienced a great deal of success. Sales of Transformers merchandise has waned as products tied to <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> reaches market saturation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Franchise brands serve as a draw in weak segments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Story driven \"franchise\" typically performs well within Hasbro's product portfolio. Consumers definitely want a story with characters that they can identify with. Evidence points to the fact that they don't like toys as a standalone product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For example, Hasbro's Preschool segment contributed heavily to Hasbro's success so far this year. Last quarter, Preschool revenue increased 17% year-over-year. Franchise products from story driven sagas contributed to the segment's gains. Specifically, products with the Star Wars, Play-Doh and Jurassic Park names attached to them performed well. By contrast, Playskool's core products declined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's Game segment fared poorly in the most recent quarter, declining 8% year-over-year. In this segment also, it was \"franchise\" products such as Monopoly and Playmation Marvel's Avengers that served as an offset. Quite possibly, publicity centering on a new Monopoly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3505606-monopoly-will-likely-boost-sales-of-hasbros-board-game\" target=\"_blank\">movie</a> and online marketing efforts increased consumer interest in the Monopoly product line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's Girls' segment revenue declined 28% year-over-year as of the most recent quarter. Once again, branded \"franchise\" products such as Disney's Descendants served as a positive offset. Motion picture publicity probably contributed to growth in Hasbro's Play-Doh Dohvinci's product line due to talks of a new <em>Play-Doh</em> movie. By contrast, toys such as Furby and Furreal Friends and to a lesser extent My Little Pony contributed to the segment's revenue decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Fundamentals</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's excellent execution of its strategies translated into solid expansion fundamentals so far in FY 2015. The company expanded its reported year-to-date revenue and free cash flow 0.1% and 12%, respectively, year-over-year. Its free cash flow deficit declined 45% year-over-year meaning that it's on track to generate significant positive free cash flow growth for the full year after the holiday season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's balance sheet is ok, though I would like to see a little less long-term debt. In the most recent quarter, Hasbro showed $551 million in cash on its balance sheet, which translates into 36% of its stockholder's equity. I like to see companies possess cash amounting to 20% or more of stockholder's equity to self-finance operations, acquisitions, dividends, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, its long-term debt amounted to 101% in the most recent quarter. I like to see companies keep long-term debt at 50% or less of stockholder's equity to keep profit choking interest at a minimum. So far this year, Hasbro's reported operating income exceeds interest expense by six times. The rule of thumb for safety lies five times or more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividends</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro sports a decent dividend. Last year, the company paid out 64% of its free cash flow in dividends, which resides a little in the high range. However, this payout percentage may go down if Hasbro manages to grow its free cash flow at a decent rate for the full year. It all depends on the all-important holiday season. Currently, Hasbro pays its shareholders $1.84 per share per year translating into an annual yield of 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Consumers love their sci fi and fantasy along with the characters within these sagas. They love to buy toys and merchandise that exhibit their likenesses. This is why these types of toys remain relevant in this technological age. Hasbro understands this and has developed a successful brand blueprint strategy. As a downside, the company is currently overvalued trading at a P/E ratio of 23 vs 18 for the S&amp;P 500, according to Morningstar. However, its successful execution of its strategy deserves at least a look and a purchase during market downturns.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - 5 Things To Consider Before Investing In Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3606706-5-things-to-consider-investing-in-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3606706-5-things-to-consider-investing-in-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3606706-5-things-to-consider-investing-in-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/22/6009511-14455524815018995-William-Bias_origin.jpeg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/22/6009511-14455524815018995-William-Bias_origin.jpeg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "quick-picks-lists", "name": "Quick Picks & Lists", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=quick-picks-lists"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
