I certainly am. We will also turn to the almost obligatory Monopoly game as the festive season rolls on.</p> <p>It got me thinking about some of the toy manufacturers and, in particular, two of the biggest names in the business: Mattel (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\">MAT</a>) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\">HAS</a>).</p> <p>Here I will take a comparative look at these two global toy giants to ascertain whether you should buy into either today.</p> <p><strong>Who are Mattel and Hasbro?</strong></p> <p>Both Mattel and Hasbro's businesses are pretty simple to understand. They make, market and sell toys and games to people. Between them, they own some of the most familiar toy brands in the world which are either owned directly or franchised to them by other companies.</p> <p>Mattel includes Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Barbie, Mega Bloks, Uno and many more. Hasbro, in turn, produces Monopoly, My Little Pony, Furby, Play-Doh and beyond. Just take a look at a brand list and you will soon find many toys and games which were, perhaps, even familiar to your own childhood.</p> <p>The toy market is attractive. Between January and October 2015, <a href=\"https://www.toyassociation.org/tia/industry_facts/salesdata/industryfacts/sales_data/sales_data.aspx?hkey=6381a73a-ce46-4caf-8bc1-72b99567df1e#.VnrIFvmLRaQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to NPD data</a>, traditional toy categories in the US had seen sales growth of 7% on the same period in 2014. This built, in turn, on a 4% growth between 2013 and 2014. This growth was also consistent across almost all the varied toy categories and echoed the prediction for <a href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2015/global-toy-sales-rise-7-percent-heading-into-the-holiday-season-npd-group-reports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">global growth over a similar period</a>.</p> <p>Global toy sales growth has been<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> pretty solid over the last decade with growth being the overall trend. All in all, it is an attractive market in which Mattel and Hasbro dominate alongside Lego. However, to this generally favourable backdro,p the two companies have not had a smooth few years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Revenue Reversal</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In recent years, the two companies' revenue have been negatively correlated to one another. Until last year, Hasbro had been struggling to find revenue growth whilst Mattel steamed ahead. However, in 2014 this reversed:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-145088946261013-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nor is the situation expected to change over the next couple of years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508896255079002-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Mattel's pain is expected to continue rolling on for a while longer whilst Hasbro looks set to build upon its strengthening performance in 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This of course, goes a long way to explain their diverging share price performances:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/29/saupload_0076b727425305fe4c03b19758944c39.png\" alt=\"MAT Chart\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro was recently testing new share price highs whilst Mattel was plumping new share price depths.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Strong Margins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite lumpy revenue growth, unsurprisingly for companies with strong brands, both Mattel and Hasbro have managed to produce compelling and consistent operating profit margins over the last five years. The average over this time period for both has comfortably been above 10%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508883907871873-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Margins have been a little more lumpy for both companies as of late. In line with its revenue reversals, it is clear that Mattel struggled to maintain its margins last year. With revenue under pressure in the future still, I suspect we will see similar margins pressure in the near future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-1450888720426259-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nonetheless, these margins remain healthy and I would expect to see Mattel's return to historic levels in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Robust Free Cash Flows</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Both companies have managed to increase their free cash flow generation over the last five years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508935245870383-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, it looks as though the prospects for FCF growth at Mattel are slim. I figure this out by taking the predicted revenues for the next two years and multiplying them by the average FCF/Sales ratio from the five-year average rate and that of the last financial year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Mattel has consistently seen its FCF/Sales ratio ahead of Hasbro over the last five years (averaging 9.55% as opposed to 7.74%) including during the last financial year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508938470571032-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite this, we see that - courtesy of declining revenues - Mattel will likely see an FCF decline over the next two years. In contrast, Hasbro - after a flat year next - will grow it modestly:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-1450893651853122-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro, therefore, looks the best bet for FCF performance over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Cash Return on Invested Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The companies have also both shown themselves to be efficient in utilizing the capital invested in them to generate FCF. This can be ascertained by the CROIC (FCF divided by the sum of the company debt and equity). Over the last five years, they have both managed to produce CROIC ratios nicely above the 10% mark which, for me, represents an exceptionally attractive cash return:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-1450892938652972-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has fairly consistently underperformed its larger peer from this perspective when looked at on a year-on-year basis:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508930433499062-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nonetheless, Hasbro's performance has been good of late and both have seen their CROIC trend rates rise modestly over the last five years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Robust Debt Levels</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last five years, both companies have seen their debt levels grow. In Mattel's case, it has grown at a CAGR of 11.8% during that period. For Hasbro, a more modest 5.12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Consequently, both have seen their debt to equity ratio grow over the same period:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-1450894994842134-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is certainly more heavily leveraged than Mattel with its five-year average debt to equity ratio nearly twice that of its larger peer:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508950632787044-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Clearly, this heavier debt load at Hasbro introduces an additional risk for the company. However, for me it is more important to see how well covered the debt levels are by FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In both cases, they seem to be pretty well covered by FCF with a five years average reading like this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508988853354568-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In theory, this means that Mattel could pay off all its debt in about two-and-a-half years using only FCF whilst Hasbro would take a little under five years to achieve the same feat. That being said, looked at from a year-on-year perspective, we see that Mattel's five-year average was aided by an unusually high FCF figure in 2012:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508990123882003-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The median coverage for Mattel is actually around 30%, meaning it could be paid off in a little over 3 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividend Diversity</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the dividend front, the two diverge quite significantly from one another:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/29/36971276-1451393926218179-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Both Hasbro and Mattel have seen their FCF payout ratios increase of late. However, clearly Mattel has struggled with this issue to a far greater extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What is more, using my predicted FCF figures alongside anticipated dividend payments of $1.52 over the next two years will see them paying out 96% and 97% of their FCF over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In contrast, using the same calculations, we should see Hasbro still with an FCF payout below 70%, even with dividend CAGR of nearly 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From a dividend perspective, therefore, although Mattel's yield looks better, I would be more happy holding Hasbro's much lower yield as it is set to continue to grow and be covered comfortably by FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At present, you may also argue that Mattel looks the better value of the two sitting on a PE of around 18.4. In contrast, Hasbro is comfortably above the 21 mark. Nonetheless, when we plug projected EPS figures into the valuation, it becomes clear that Hasbro looks the better bet:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/12/23/36971276-14508943446483433-Dividend-Drive.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What is more, Mattel may see its share price under further pressure if the sustainability of its dividend becomes even more questionable. Overall, Hasbro's valuation seems fairer when looked at from a projected EPS perspective and also from the point of view of the stability of this valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Mattel or Hasbro?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I would avoid Mattel at present simply due to the threat to its dividend and consequent threat to its share price. Both companies are impressive businesses. However, of the two, Hasbro is looking the healthiest in the near term. Mattel is a healthy company which has chalked up an impressive historic performance against its already well-performing peer. Nonetheless, right now, Hasbro looks the better bet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Fair Value: Should You Buy Now?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Of course, even if they are attractive buys. We have to ask what their fair value is. I calculate this by taking the average PE ratio for the company and multiplying it by the average EPS prediction for the next two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For Hasbro, the five-year average PE has sat at 17.4 whilst Mattel's has been lower at 15.5. I think that is a fair reflection of the value of both companies at present.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Using the above PE figure, we have a basic fair value for both companies like this:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Mattel - $20.46</li> <li>Hasbro - $64.09</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I then adjust this by the amount of cash each company holds on its books. Doing so produces a cash-adjusted fair value of:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Mattel - $23.34</li> <li>Hasbro - $71.24</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a result, I would also argue that at present Hasbro is trading around fair value (sitting above the basic fair value, but below the cash-adjusted fair value). In contrast, Mattel is trading significantly above its fair value. Hasbro, therefore, despite a more modest dividend yield, looks a better bet of the two at today's prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Notes</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unless otherwise stated, all graphs and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.
