But Hasbro did fine. The free cash flows remained strong, the net debt continued to decrease throughout the year and we also see the net interest expenses decreasing in Q4, and this will set Hasbro up for a strong FY 2021.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/8/saupload_f7fa461b56bc3b6df1463f1f20cfed9d.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\">Data by YCharts</figure><h2><strong>A strong EPS and a high free cash flow result are promising for 2021</strong></h2> <p>During FY 2020, Hasbro reported<span> </span>revenue of almost $5.5B which is an increase of approximately 15% compared to the revenue in FY 2019. The cost of sales actually decreased, both in absolute numbers as well as when expressed as a percentage of revenue, but this was compensated by a higher program cost amortization and an increase in the royalty payments to third parties. Investors may perhaps be a little bit surprised to see the operating profit actually came in lower than in FY 2019 ($502M vs. $652M), but this difference could entirely be explained by the $219M acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these expenses, the operating profit would have increased to just under $720M, an increase of more than 10% compared to FY 2019.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/12881201_16128324995807_rId4.png\" data-width=\"1177\" data-height=\"499\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/14678391.pdf\">SEC filing</a></p> <p>The interest expenses doubled considering the Hasbro balance sheet contains much more debt than a year ago, and this is obviously related to the multibillion-dollar acquisition of EntertainmentOne which closed right after the end of FY 2019. That being said, we see interest expenses are slowly decreasing again. While full-year interest expenses came in at around $201M (for an average of just over $50M per quarter), we see the Q3 interest expense was just $47.4M. This means the average interest expense<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in the first nine months of the year was in excess of $51M per quarter, so we clearly see the total interest expenses decrease and Hasbro has a shot at reducing the interest expenses by at least 10% to less than $180M in the current financial year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The bottom line with a net income of $225M ($222.5M attributable to the shareholders of Hasbro) may seem disappointing, but again, this includes quite a few non-recurring items including the $200M+ acquisition-related costs. You can almost be certain the FY 2021 net income will more than double, and likely triple as the new acquisition gets integrated into the existing company structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The cash flow statements also provide a better overview of Hasbro\u2019s actual cash flows (excluding the non-cash items which have a major negative impact on the income statement).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The reported operating cash flow was approximately $976M but this includes a $60M investment in the working capital position, so the adjusted operating cash flow was roughly $1.03B. The total capex was just $128M, so Hasbro had an underlying free cash flow of around $900M, but we shouldn\u2019t rely on this number too much given the massive amount of one-offs recorded in FY 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/12881201_16128324995807_rId6.png\" data-width=\"1166\" data-height=\"664\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: SEC filings</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In FY 2019, Hasbro had an adjusted operating cash flow of $857M and a capex of $134M for a net free cash flow of approximately $724M. That being said, it also had to book a $100M deferred acquisition payment in FY 2019 so the total free cash flow result came in a bit lower than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Needless to say, the FY 2020 results were difficult to analyze as the acquisition-related expenses made it tough for the income statement to show its true performance, but I fully expect FY2021 to be much better when it comes to the reported net income. Although there undoubtedly will be additional integration expenses, I would expect Hasbro to report<span> </span>net income in excess of $600M while the normalized free cash flow result should be higher than that.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Yes, the recent acquisition was expensive, but Hasbro can definitely handle it</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As of the end of 2019, Hasbro had a net cash position of just over half a billion dollars, but this was reverted to a net debt position of approximately $3.65B due to the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/hasbro-entertainment-one-acquisition-3-8-billion-1203453402/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition of EntertainmentOne</a> during the year. While investors who have been used to seeing Hasbro running a balance sheet with just a very moderate amount of debt may be spooked, there really isn\u2019t anything to be worried about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sure, $3.65B is a huge amount but considering Hasbro generated an EBITDA of almost $800M, an adjusted EBITDA exceeding $1B and a very strong free cash flow result, the debt ratio is still pretty reasonable for a company that has a history of generating very strong cash flows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Investment thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro isn\u2019t cheap, but given the company\u2019s dominant position in the entertainment market and its recent acquisition of EntertainmentOne, Hasbro deserves to trade at a premium valuation. For FY 2021, I expect Hasbro to be trading at a free cash flow yield of approximately 6%. This will allow it to continue to pay its dividend ($0.68/quarter for $2.72 per year) while rapidly reducing its net debt. The combination of an increasing EBITDA and a decreasing net debt should keep the debt ratio in line with the expectations, and drop below 3. The EntertainmentOne acquisition was expensive, but Hasbro\u2019s financial performance is clearly strong enough to absorb the impact and the company should be back to its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404412-hasbro-inc-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript\">2-2.5 leverage ratio</a> by the end of 2022.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I currently do not have a position in Hasbro, but I have been looking for a good entry point.</p> </div>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Impressive FY 2020 Free Cash Flow Will Help It Digest The Big Acquisition. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404450-hasbros-impressive-fy-2020-free-cash-flow-will-help-digest-big-acquisition?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><em>Consider joining</em> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-investment-doctor/research\"><em><strong>European Small-Cap Ideas</strong></em></a> <em>to gain exclusive access to actionable research on appealing Europe-focused investment opportunities, and to the real-time chat function to discuss ideas with similar-minded investors!</em></p><p><em><strong>NEW at ESCI: A dedicated EUROPEAN REIT PORTFOLIO! </strong></em></p><p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/3/11/12881201-15523351885598392.png\"></p><p></p>", "marketingBullet": "Looking for a helping hand in the market?
