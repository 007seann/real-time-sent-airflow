It is noted that many savvy retailers and importers advanced their orders, meaning the issue may be decidedly overblown and the holidays may be more normal than some expect for companies like Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>), Mattel (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a></span>) and Target (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a></span>). The worldwide energy crunch is also on the radar this week, with companies that have natural-gas exposure and benefit from rising oil prices as well looking particularly attractive. Cimarex Energy (XEC), which won shareholder approval this week to merge with Cabot Oil &amp; Gas (COG), is singled out. Marathon Oil (MRO) and Royal Dutch Shell, Cheniere Energy (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNG\" title=\"Cheniere Energy, Inc.\">LNG</a></span>) and
