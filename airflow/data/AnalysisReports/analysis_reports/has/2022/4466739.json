That changes today. We're going to take a look at this<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> business, its fundamentals, and see if this company makes for a worthy investment in a conservative dividend investor's portfolio.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If it does, we will show you where we would target the company with a \"BUY\" here and what the expected return could be for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's get going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/saupload_150px-Hasbro_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"Hasbro logo.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro - What does the company do?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As I mentioned, the company's name derives from the Hassenfeld Brothers, which was the original name. It's an American conglomerate with trademarks and products in toys, board games, and media assets. It's headquartered in Rhode Island.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636188473905469_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"773\" data-height=\"606\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636188473905469.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company describes itself as a \"global play and entertainment company\" with a strategy focused on the brand blueprint, which involves re-imagining, re-inventing, and re-igniting their own controlled brands as well as imagining new ones through product innovations and a wide range of consumer offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's segmentation and reporting is based on a modified geographical model, with US/Canada, International and Entertainment, Licensing, and Digital making up the core segments. Essentially, physical toys and products are sold through the geographical segment, while digital products and licensing is handled through the Entertainment arm. Aside from these, the company has its Global Operations segment, which handles some production of toy and game products, but the company has, since 2015, sold many of its production assets to Cartamundi NV, a Belgian company that manufactures much of the board games, cards, collectibles and packages the company uses. Cartamundi has become one of the world's largest playing card manufacturers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since we're talking Hasbro, we have to talk SCM and manufacturing. Hasbro, while having some amount of production, manufactures the absolute majority of its products in third-party facilities, primarily in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has an outspoken goal of less dependence on China as a manufacturing base and continues to diversify its global sourcing base and mix. An increase in production in India and Vietnam has been the recipe here, but the fact that Hasbro does not own its own manufacturing base of course increases its dependence on other businesses - and means the company lacks a measure of control here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361893987333977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1128\" data-height=\"627\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361893987333977.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In terms of <strong>products, </strong>the company has:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>eOne Business, which focuses on development, financing, and production as well as sales of entertainment content. The segment spans film, television, and music, merchandising and licensing as well as digital content. The portfolio of children's content involves Peppa Pig, PJ Masks, Cupcake &amp; Dino: General Services, and Ricky Zoom. The segment is also a major independent producer of content in NA, which is sold to broadcasters on a series-by-series or individual show basis. eOne was acquired in 2020 and the company expects this to be a grower going forward.</li> <li>Storytelling &amp; Entertainment Initiatives, which holds many well-known global brands and focuses on entertainment-based storytelling through the Allspark Pictures and Allspark Animation brands. The company is in the process of integrating eOne's creative talent and network of studios and eventually expects eOne to lead the production of entertainment-driven storytelling. The company's storytelling work, and Allspark pictures, have released films such as My Little Pony, Bumblebee, and others. Also found in this segment are the company's digital products, such as Magic: The Gathering Arena as well as the digital products from other brands.</li> <li>The company speaks about <strong>Brand</strong> <strong>Portfolios</strong> when it talks about its main operations, and these are further categorized into four sub-segments. (1) Franchise Brands; (2) Partner Brands; (3) Hasbro Gaming; and (4) Emerging Brands.</li> <li> <strong>Franchise Brands</strong> are the company's most significant properties, believed by Hasbro to drive significant revenues. The company currently has seven franchise brands, which are Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh, Baby Alive, and Transformers. These 7 brands together represent <strong>more than 50% of annual revenues</strong>, though this has dropped to around 42% including eOne.</li> <li> <strong>Hasbro Gaming </strong>holds brands such as Connect4, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Jenga, Game of Life, Operation, Scrabble, Twister, Trivial Pursuit, and many others. It also involves new social game brands, as well as certain card games.</li> <li> <strong>Emerging Brands</strong> are the brands that Hasbro believes have potential, and are fully controlled by Hasbro, but not yet significant enough to have \"Franchise\" status in the company's eyes. Here we find brands such as Littlest Pet Shop, Easy Bake, Furreal Friends, Supersoaker, Playskool, and others. The company also recently in 2018 bought the Power Rangers brand, which is also found here.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636189422031158_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1113\" data-height=\"449\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636189422031158.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's geographical revenue breakdown is highly US/CAN-focused, with nearly 40% of annual revenues coming from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361885759826417.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is a BBB- rated company with quite some amount of debt, making it surprisingly \"unsafe\" in terms of these fundamentals and credit rating. However, the credit rating is not reflected in the company's share price development, which over the past 20 years has been stellar. We'll dive more into this into the valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro navigates a careful balance between focusing on physical play, which is the company's main income, as well as integrating digital play and digital media as well as entertainment franchises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a results basis, the company's 2020 earnings even with COVID-19 was quite excellent. The company delivered annual revenues of almost $5.5B, with adjusted earnings margins of around 8-9%, and operating cash flow of about $1B. The company also had a cash balance of $1.45B at YE2020 and overall has been fairly stable in delivering solid revenues of around $4.5-6B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361896464200826_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1095\" data-height=\"612\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361896464200826.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has also delivered consistent $645+ annual cash flows despite the pandemic and has been doing so for 4-5 years at this point. The company's dividend is well-covered currently sitting at a 2020 payout ratio of 72.7%, though this will likely fall when compared to 2020. The company has averaged a dividend growth rate of almost 20% for the past 19 years, though this was beginning with a level of almost nil. Also, the company is not a consistent dividend grower but has historically increased its dividend by 100%, 33%, 50%, and many years 0%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As it stands though, the company has firmly outperformed the overall S&amp;P 500, delivering annualized RoR of 12.4% compared to only 7.4% for the past 19 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So at its heart and essence, I consider Hasbro to be a qualitative business with good fundamentals - even if credit rating and debt are a bit on the high side and the dividend is a bit so-so in terms of growth. The company's current yield is about 2.8% - neither astoundingly good nor terribly bad.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's look at recent results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro - How has the company been doing?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Company results are quite excellent. The company delivered quarterly revenues above an annualized $6B, at around $1.97B, with operating profit closing in on $400 million. On a YoY level, sales and profits are up in high single or low double digits, with particularly good performance coming from Wizards of the Coast, Digital Gaming, and the Entertainment segment. Physical toy sales were slightly negative/flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636194437721503_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1086\" data-height=\"614\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636194437721503.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, on a 9M basis, all of the company's brand portfolios and brands showed excellent growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361945336365807_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"760\" data-height=\"534\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361945336365807.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Particular highlights can be seen in the Entertainment segment, where the company posted massive revenue increases and massive growth in operating profit, which in little more than 2 years has gone from a loss-making business to one delivering profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361946128681493_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1070\" data-height=\"500\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16361946128681493.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I'm personally a consumer of Wizards of the Coast products and services, and COVID-19 has really seen the love for these products and services grow, with 50% YTD revenue growth and similar levels of profit growth. Both Magic: The Gathering, D&amp;D, and other products were responsible for growth here, with a strong performance from several key releases in 2Q21 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's disappointing results in physical toys, or consumer products, were not in any way due to declining demand - but the SCM and shipping constraints and challenges experienced by many companies. Freight costs and shipping constraints drove profits down, leading to quarterly declines in operating products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a YTD basis, however, things were actually good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-163619478265302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1068\" data-height=\"471\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-163619478265302.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company also managed to repay some of its debt, $400M in 3Q21 alone, bringing the repaid debt for 2021 so far almost to $1B. This goes well to address some of my main concerns with this investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Results were good, and the company expects continued high demand for its services and products. Much of Hasbro's business is not impacted that much by COVID-19, or if impacted, the impact is a positive one due to more at-home kids meaning more necessity for entertainment and the company's products and services. Speaking anecdotally, me and my friends have been playing more board games and social games than ever before during the pandemic, so I see the net result for Hasbro as a good one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's look at the valuation of this company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro - What is the valuation?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's valuation is pretty appealing, provided that you accept the thesis that the company deserves a premium. There's some volatility to earnings here, but overall the company has delivered fairly impressive annual growth rates, although Hasbro is in no ways a massive growth machine or a company you should expect to bring about triple-digits of capital appreciation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636195296618538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1090\" data-height=\"923\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-1636195296618538.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company trades at a premium of close to 20X usually, with current valuation around 20.5X. At first glance, this might seem very expensive for this company. However, when we consider that not even COVID-19 has seen this company drop to anywhere close to 15X P/E, and the last time it traded below this was almost 10 years ago, we start to see valuation trends here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the company is hardly good at meeting targets with a 42% 10% MoE-adjusted miss ratio, we have to consider what I would argue to be global, counter-cyclical tendencies. Hasbro has an extremely appealing mix of businesses and segments, and a world-class brand portfolio that can weather any storm I can think of. They are also addressing their biggest flaw - their relatively high debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When forecasting Hasbro we can work from a range of 15-20.5X P/E as a forward multiple, and on current forecasts, averaging 17% annual forward EPS growth, get returns that are market-beating on <strong>any</strong> of these forward valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From the high returns we get by assuming a 20.6X P/E of around 62% in 3-4 years...<span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16362179827749522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1059\" data-height=\"857\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16362179827749522.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">...To more modest returns at 15-16x P/E of around 8-9% annually, or 31% in 3-4 years which comes to around half, all of it is \"good enough\" when you consider what you're investing in - at least insofar as I see it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analysts give the company a very generous valuation, essentially equating the 2022E 20X P/E multiple at around an average of $114/share, with over 50% of analysts currently recommending a \"BUY\" on Hasbro. There is some tendency to overvalue the company here, but I would still say that the current market price fails to take into consideration what the company may achieve once full integration, SCM returning to normal and optimization has been seen. At that point, I believe the company will indeed be capable of meeting the optimistic forecasts here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I give Hasbro a \"BUY\", and consider it a fair premium value here with an upside of 9-10% annually on a conservative estimate, up to 15-16% annually on a premium multiple. My price target for Hasbro is well below current analysts, but comes to around $99/share, equating to a slight undervaluation to current share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, there are multiple ways to go forward here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">How To Invest In Hasbro</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Option 1 - Long-Term Investment</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Buying the common share is a valid approach at this valuation, and I consider HAS buyable at current valuation, with an average upside of 9-16% annually and a valuation upside of around 3-7%. I'm bullish on HAS.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Option 2 - Selling cash-secured Puts</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Selling cash-covered put options is another good way to make money off a company while waiting for it to drop further and making money until then. Because of the company's position, and a lower price being even more appealing, this could make it perfect for a nice put.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As of writing this article, I was able to find the following put.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/6/49836612-16362195956117544.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Author's Data, Google Sheets, Option data from IBKR/Yahoo Finance)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I see this as a pretty appealing option for Hasbro at this time. At a $90 strike you're bidding to buy at a price that the company hasn't seen in over a year (with the slight exception of the crash some time ago for a day or so), and making around 11-12%. You're also declaring a willingness to buy at an appealing price, locking in a potential yield of almost 3.2% at this price. The capital outlay is a bit high here, but it's still a nice and conservative option at this price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you want to increase the safety, you could drop the strike to $87.5, but at that time, your returns would be no more than 7.72% annualized until the strike in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My choice for Hasbro and put options would be this one - the $90 strike puts for April 2022.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <strong>Option 3</strong> <strong>- Selling Covered Calls</strong> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I don't see this as a particularly good nor valid option at this time, given the very likely scenario of assignment, and the company's continued performance expected out of Hasbro at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I don't view covered calls as interesting here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current Hasbro thesis is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>An amazing toy company with substantial upside to the current valuations. The company is qualitative and owns a brand portfolio that's second to very few companies and peers on the planet. At current multiples, I see a decent upside, and a potential for 7-12% conservative 3-4 year annualized RoR.</li> <li>The catalyst for continued performance by Hasbro is supply chain normalizations, integration of M&amp;As and efficiencies, as well as continued good performance from the company's segments.</li> <li>I consider Hasbro a \"BUY\" here - though given a choice, I'd go for the April -22 PUTS at a $90 strike. I may either write these, or bid on these options come market opening.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Remember, I'm all about:</strong></h2> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight, and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.</li> <li>If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1.</li> <li>If the company doesn't go into overvaluation, but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows.</li> <li>I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This process has allowed me to triple my net worth in less than 7 years - and that is all I intend to continue doing (even if I don't expect the same rates of return for the next few years).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you're interested in significantly higher returns, then I'm probably not for you. If you're interested in 10% yields, I'm not for you either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you however want to grow your money conservatively, safely, and harvest well-covered dividends while doing so, and your time frame is 5-30 years, then I might be for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS is a \"BUY\" here with a 5% upside due to undervaluation, and a long-term potential annual RoR of 7-12%.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thank you for reading.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Why You Should Consider Playing With Hasbro Stock. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4466739-why-you-should-consider-playing-with-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I am Wolf Report, a senior analyst and private portfolio manager with 10+ years experience finding ideas in European and North American markets.
