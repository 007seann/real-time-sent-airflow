Several factors have caused me to look at the company again. Hasbro just published its 10-K, and that\u2019s always an exciting read. I also built a new Dungeons and Dragons character, and whenever I do that, I inevitably think of the company that is making buckets of money on this and so many other great assets. In case the curiosity is too much for you, I\u2019ll tell you that my new character is a dragonborn ranger. I\u2019ve never played a dragonborn before, and I promise to keep you posted on our progress.</p> <p>In this article I want to review my investment thesis and decide whether it\u2019s reasonable to continue to hold the shares. I\u2019ll make this determination by looking at the financial results and the stock as a thing quite distinct from the underlying business. I\u2019ll also suggest a risk to the bullish thesis here. Finally, I\u2019ll update you on the short puts that just expired, dear readers. My primary motivation for doing so is, of course, to brag. There\u2019s another (far less important to me) motivation than ego gratification to write about this, though, and that is to demonstrate the risk reducing, return enhancing power of these things.</p> <p>I imagine you\u2019re a busy crowd, dear readers. You\u2019ve got dungeons to explore, Beholders to negotiate with, and spells to memorize, so I\u2019ll come right to the point. I think this is a wonderful business, and in some ways the shares are cheaper now than they were when I last looked at the name. That said, I think the assumptions embedded in the current price are a bit unrealistic, and so I\u2019m switching to neutral on this name. I\u2019ll neither sell nor add<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to my position here. That said, I will be initiating another short put trade because the last one was so successful. If you don\u2019t currently own shares, I think this is the best way forward for you at the moment.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Financial Snapshot</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In my previous missive on this name, I went into some depth about why the dividend is very well covered in this case. People who are interested, and are in a particularly masochistic frame of mind are encouraged to review my earlier work dealing with that subject specifically. Suffice to say that I consider the dividend very well covered. The fact that the shares are priced at a forward dividend yield of ~3% is an enormous bonus in my estimation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In this financial update, I want to focus on answering the question \u201cwhy did net earnings decline by 56% from 2019 in spite of a 15.8% uptick in revenue?\u201d There are several causes for the decline in GAAP earnings. For example, there was a $218 million acquisition cost that hit the financials in 2020, up from $0. There was also a $301 million uptick in program cost amortization, which was driven largely by the eOne business, which experiences higher program cost amortization as a percentage of net sales. Royalty expenses also increased by $155 million, which is a very good sign obviously. Finally, amortization of intangible assets increased by ~$98 million, largely driven by the Power Rangers property rights. Finally, Selling, Distribution and Administration expenses increased $215 million, driven by the eOne business and by higher freight expenses related to Covid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Much of these expenses are GAAP, obviously, and these have a limited impact on the company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, at least in the short term. In spite of the fact that net interest expense has ballooned by $121 million, I think the dividend remains well covered. For that reason, I\u2019d be happy to continue to own the shares at the right price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/26/saupload_XK9Hmv45Fdjd5mjkwdKSE_TkX36ZmoB6bUAar1DrBDdcyYdjIdtP1dzd-qRwv575cyjFmUOta2reCb3BceUFXT89aey1sVix7k12tiAeOQaPF-T3Q8AjuJ1VWTc9p-fE-oylLUBW.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"175\" data-width=\"755\" data-height=\"212\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Company filings</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Stock</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019ve written it before, and I\u2019ll write it again, dear readers. A great company like this one can be a good or a bad investment depending entirely on the price paid. I know that\u2019s a relatively easy concept to grasp in the abstract, but I\u2019m didactic enough to want to make the point explicit by using Hasbro itself as an example. So to pick a random, and highly convenient date totally at random, if an investor bought shares of Hasbro Inc. in mid-October of 2019 at a price of ~$122, they\u2019d be sitting on a loss of ~23% as of now. Had they waited five months and bought at $45, they\u2019d be sitting on a gain of ~109%. It\u2019s not like the narrative changed very much from one period to the next. The differential in results was entirely a function of the price paid. For that reason, I want to be rather hardnosed when it comes to buying stock. I\u2019ll only do it if the shares are reasonably priced. By \u201creasonably\u201d, I mean \u201ccheaply.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My regular reader victims know that I judge whether shares are cheap or not in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like earnings, free cash flow and the like. Ideally, I want to see the company trading at a discount to both the overall market and its own history. In my previous missive on this name, I went on about how the shares were inexpensive because they were trading near the low end of their historical range, at a price to free cash flow just over 17 times. On that basis, the shares are about 10% cheaper now, and they were only cheaper than they are now at the height (depths?) of 2020\u2019s large Covid inspired selloff.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/26/saupload_8b3fc3a9eeb279595169bbc2dcbbd51b.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"419\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, I want to try to understand the assumptions that are currently embedded in price. In order to do this, I turn to the work described by Professor Stephen Penman in his book \"Accounting for Value.\" In this book, Penman walks investors through how they can use the magic of highschool algebra to isolate the \"g\" (growth) variable in a standard finance formula. This enables us to work out what the market must be assuming about the future for a given company. Applying this methodology to Hasbro at the moment suggests that the market is forecasting a long term (i.e. perpetual) growth rate of ~6.3%. I consider this to be a somewhat optimistic forecast, given the history of more staid 3% growth, and for that reason, I consider the shares to be modestly overpriced at the moment. For that reason, I want to neither sell nor add to my position here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>(Slight) Risk to the Bullish Case</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019m not alone in worrying that movies set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic The Gathering worlds are financially very risky propositions. Everyone I play these games with are old enough to remember the last time someone tried to produce a Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOCGeOtjIHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">movie</a>, and the results were as muted as the performances were, uh, \"aggressive.\u201d As a side note, I met Jeremy Irons in the 1990s when he was still an actor. Anyway, the nature of these properties is such that this is a very challenging IP to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgnZFdtoyHM\" rel=\"nofollow\">produce</a>. Because the company will need to appeal to relatively hardcore gamers like myself, while also appealing to a wider audience. Many decades of experience trying to introduce \u201cnormal\u201d friends, family, and girlfriends to this game indicate to me that bringing along non-fans will be a challenge. At the same time, the company runs the risk of alienating super fans by taking a \u201csubversive\u201d approach to any story is a source of immeasurable cringe to many of us super-fans. I, like so many of my peers, want our expectations to remain very much sustained, upheld and definitely not \u201csubverted.\u201d</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Options Update</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In my previous missive on this name, I recommended selling the January 2021 puts with a strike of $50 for $3.10. These expired worthless last month, which enhances the return on these shares by ~4.4%. To remind investors, had I been exercised on these, I would have bought them at a price ~33% below the then current price, which is the definition of lower risk. Since this didn\u2019t happen, I simply pocketed the premium, which is the definition of higher return. I hope you\u2019re starting to see why I consider short puts to be a win-win strategy, dear reader.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given that I like to try to repeat success when I can, I\u2019m recommending a very similar trade again. Specifically, I think selling the July puts with a strike of $70 makes the most sense at the moment. These are priced at $1.30-$1.95, so if the investor simply takes the bid on these, and is subsequently exercised, they\u2019ll be buying at a net price ~27% below the current market price. This price would drive the dividend yield to about 4%. If the shares remain above that price, obviously the investor simply pockets the premium as I just did on the puts that expired.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now that you're hopefully excited about the prospects of a win-win trade, dear readers, it's time for me to spoil the mood as I so often do by writing about risk. The fact of the matter is that every investment comes with risk, and short puts are no exception. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. The risks of share ownership should be obvious to readers on this forum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money, and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock - they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income and will, therefore, be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. I like my sleep far too much to play short puts in this way. I'm only willing to sell puts on companies I'm willing to buy at prices I'm willing to pay. For that reason, being exercised isn't the hardship for me that it might be for many other put writers. My advice is that if you are considering this strategy yourself, you would be wise to only ever write puts on companies you'd be happy to own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I'll conclude this rather long discussion of risks by looking again as the specifics of the trade I'm recommending this morning. I'll be selling the puts described above that have one of two outcomes. Either the shares remain above $70 over the next five months, at which point I will have generated ~1.85% in five months, which I consider to be acceptable. If the shares fall in price, I will buy the shares at a net price ~27% below the current, fairly priced level. Both outcomes are very acceptable in my view, so I consider this trade to be the definition of \"risk reducing.\" That's an ironic way to end a discussion of risk, but it's the truth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think Hasbro is an excellent business, and I\u2019m happy to continue to own the shares given my original cost base. Some part of me hopes for yet another market correction so I can acquire more at $70. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth buying more at the moment, so I\u2019m switching to neutral on this excellent business. I admit that the shares may drop in price from here, but I am comfortable sitting on the well covered dividend. My only fear where this company is concerned is that they produce a movie that is as abominable as the one made two decades ago. If you don\u2019t own shares, I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying at current prices, but I think you could do worse than selling the puts described above.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Switching To Neutral On Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4409832-switching-to-neutral-hasbro?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "104099", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "315104", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "578431", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4409832-switching-to-neutral-hasbro", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4409832-switching-to-neutral-hasbro", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/26/saupload_XK9Hmv45Fdjd5mjkwdKSE_TkX36ZmoB6bUAar1DrBDdcyYdjIdtP1dzd-qRwv575cyjFmUOta2reCb3BceUFXT89aey1sVix7k12tiAeOQaPF-T3Q8AjuJ1VWTc9p-fE-oylLUBW.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/26/saupload_XK9Hmv45Fdjd5mjkwdKSE_TkX36ZmoB6bUAar1DrBDdcyYdjIdtP1dzd-qRwv575cyjFmUOta2reCb3BceUFXT89aey1sVix7k12tiAeOQaPF-T3Q8AjuJ1VWTc9p-fE-oylLUBW.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "104099", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "patrick-doyle", "userId": 48515253, "tagId": 578431, "bio": "<p>I'm a quant investment newsletter writer who marries fundamental analysis with the latest research in momentum.
