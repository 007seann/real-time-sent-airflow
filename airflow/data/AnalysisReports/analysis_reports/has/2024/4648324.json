I<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> have a relatively small position in the stock but, given the price drop, I feel compelled to review the name yet again, because obviously a stock priced at $46 is a less risky investment than the same stock when it\u2019s priced at $63. I want to review the financial results, and the valuation to see if the shares are reasonably priced at the moment. Additionally, I want to compare this stock to the risk free rate, because, once again, we\u2019re not seeking \u201creturns\u201d, we\u2019re seeking \u201crisk adjusted\u201d returns.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My articles each come with a \u201cthesis statement\u201d because I know that reading 1,250 words of text can be tiring, and reading 1,250 words of my text can be particularly tiring. Given that, I offer a thesis statement paragraph at the beginning of each of my articles that offers you the \u201cgist\u201d of my thinking. I think the financial performance has been soft relative to the same period last year, in spite of the company\u2019s heroic efforts at cost control. That written, I think the dividend remains relatively secure. Since the shares have dropped in price, the dividend yield is now significantly higher than the risk free rate. Given that, the stockholder will receive about 32% more cash than the Treasury Note holder over the next decade assuming zero growth in the dividend. The dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 9% over the past decade. I don\u2019t expect that growth rate to continue, but I think it reasonable to expect some growth in the dividend. Additionally, the stock is trading at a near decade low valuation. To my way of thinking the potential returns are worth the risks associated with investing at this point. Given that, I\u2019ll be adding to my position as soon as the market opens.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Snapshot</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To refresh your collective memories, in my most recent article, I lamented the fact that the first six months of this year have been rather soft compared to the same period a year ago. A host of factors conspired to drop net income by about $460.3 million in 2023 relative to 2022. That written, I also pointed out that things are much better now than they were in 2019. I also suggested my view that the dividend was secure, but was not likely to rise much from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking at the 9 month results, and the stock price drop makes more sense in my estimation. Revenue was about 11% lower, and net income has cratered relative to the same time in 2022, down fully $759.8 million. Even more distressingly, it\u2019s worse than 2019 by $681.3 million. Now, a more generously minded person than me would say that much of the drop in operating profit and net income can be attributed to the $450 million uptick in loss on assets held for sale, and $231 million in impairment of goodwill. That\u2019s a fine argument as far as it goes, but we should remember that impairments, and losses are still just that: losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, in fairness to management, they have done a very good job of controlling costs in the teeth of slowing demand. the company\u2019s cost cutting efforts this year are very good in my estimation. While revenue is down dramatically, total operating costs are down about 7.5% from the same period a year ago, with \u201ccost of sales\u201d, \u201cprogram cost amortization\u201d, and \u201croyalties\u201d down dramatically by 15%, 11%, and 11.8% respectively. Additionally, cash from operations were up about 27% from the same time last year, and cash actually drives dividends and their sustainability. Given that, I\u2019d be happy to buy more if, as a game show tag line once opined, \u201cthe price is right.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/6/saupload_jBPzOtAFt7xnJvopSk58mnTgqRtf1bt8zMAyQ9wJGLtvc72uNMZxbXxwoqA4JJzA0p7TwFQuDbQ5D6voJbwq8nwPOoq0_Ja8D84eoObGAQHVMCnn66zOwHs-dH0rLnn5Opdp_DDLrcjr__T6-4bsnZQ.png\" alt=\"A financial history of Hasbro from 2015 to the present\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Hasbro Financials <span>(Hasbro investor relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Stock</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you read me regularly, you know that I attempt to buy stocks when they\u2019re on sale because I think cheap stocks represent a great combination of lower risk and higher potential return. They\u2019re lower risk because much of the bad news has already been wrung out of price. They offer potentially higher returns because any surprisingly good news that happens at a \u201cdog\u201d may drive the shares higher quickly. So far this strategy seems to have worked out pretty <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/patrick-doyle\" rel=\"nofollow\">well</a>. If you read me regularly, you know that I measure cheapness in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like earnings, sales, free cash flow, and the like. Ideally, I want to see a stock trading at a discount to both its own history and the overall market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To refresh your collective memories, in my previous article on this name, I clutched my proverbial pearls over the fact that the PE, PS ratios were 74.2 and 1.6 respectively. The excessive PE was obviously caused by the write-downs etc., so that may get a \u201cpass\u201d, but I thought it unwise for the market to pay 1.6 times sales for a company that was obviously going through a soft patch. Additionally, the dividend yield at the time was only about 4.36%. Fast forward to the present and here\u2019s the lay of the land at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/6/saupload_cf892081813391f72f87434f40a4df57.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/6/saupload_3ba9ab492b8d3097fb1a09f4a4a0ab32.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It seems that the PE hasn\u2019t moved much, but at least the PS ratio is about 26% cheaper as you\u2019d expect from the price drop. Additionally, it\u2019s very near a decade low, which is encouraging in my view. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the dividend yield is up nicely by about 40%, per the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/6/saupload_2a5409ba43de67da2a93002481fa3091.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unlike my last visit to this company, shareholders are actually receiving a positive risk premium of about 146 basis <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y/download-data?startDate=9/7/2023&amp;endDate=11/01/2023&amp;countryCode=bx\" rel=\"nofollow\">points</a>. The question is whether or not that is a sufficient risk premium to uptick on the stock. I think a necessary exercise is to actually compare the cash flows received by a stockholder and a Treasury Note holder over the next decade to make this comparison. Thankfully, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ve compiled the results in a table, and I present it below for your reading pleasure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/6/saupload_nCp96b9EbFR-P-pCUDclsIvmHaWILwSBSgGahygyh9Z2tD0SiA5X5To2utooP9uFPAqUxjEilBEcLGcrP35fZMFLWPdwxq6GZjNGUcFdxokstBb-s2Kvc0m5-67hvEjdc6jAA8b98J7jY4b_YnTin_U.png\" alt=\"A comparison of the cash flows from Treasury Notes and common stocks.\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Hasbro Dividend v Treasury Cash Flows <span>(author calculations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Leaving discounting and tax implications aside, over a 10 year period, a stockholder will receive about 31.5% more cash than will the Treasury Note buyer. That assumes zero growth in the dividend, which may be considered a conservative assumption given that the dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 9% over the past decade.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Everyone\u2019s risk tolerances are different, obviously, but I\u2019m comfortable buying, given the above cash flows. I think there\u2019s some chance that a Treasury Note is going to generate a capital gain, but more than 32% excess cash is \u201cnothing to sneeze at\u201d as the young people say. Also, I think the thing that will drive Treasuries higher is falling interest rates. If rates fall, the relative attractiveness of a 6% dividend yield will become apparent, which should buoy the stock further. There\u2019s certainly risk here, but I think you could do worse than buying this stock when it\u2019s trading near a decade low price to sales multiple. Given the above, I\u2019ll be adding to my position when the market opens.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Buying More Hasbro. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4648324-hasbro-q3-earnings-buying-more-stock?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "", "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "104099", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "499889", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "578431", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "692842", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "764066", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "606619", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "662815", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "603709", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4648324-hasbro-q3-earnings-buying-more-stock", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4648324-hasbro-q3-earnings-buying-more-stock", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1476976884/image_1476976884.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1476976884/image_1476976884.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1476976884/image_1476976884.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1476976884/image_1476976884.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "104099", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "patrick-doyle", "userId": 48515253, "tagId": 578431, "bio": "<p>I'm a quant investment newsletter writer who marries fundamental analysis with the latest research in momentum.
