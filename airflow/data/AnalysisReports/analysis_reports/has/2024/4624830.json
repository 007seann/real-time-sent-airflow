Financials</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">General Overview</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the TTM period, Hasbro- down 17.67%- has experienced price action similar to TradingView's Toymakers Index- down 18.61%- and poorer to the broader market, as represented by the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>)- up 8.30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911102625135362_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1787\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911102625135362.png\" alt=\"Hasbro (Dark Blue) vs Industry &amp;

This group includes Hasbro's principal rival and the owner of Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), Paw Patrol producer, Spin Master (TOY.TO), and action figure maker- among other things- JAKKS Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" title=\"JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\">JAKK</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110747627432_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"812\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110747627432.png\" alt=\"Comparable Companies\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>barchart.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the trailing 3-month period, Hasbro has experienced the second-best price action, behind only Mattel- itself spurred by the publicity of the Barbie movie- and enabled by the second-poorest yearly price performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite this, Hasbro maintains a strong position on a multiples basis and when addressing the firm's fiscal condition. For instance, Hasbro maintains the second-lowest P/CF alongside the second-highest ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This works alongside the company's highest book value per share to ensure investors remain in a secure business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moreover, with the highest- by a significant margin- dividend of the peer group, investors can expect outsized returns from Hasbro's secure catalogue of IP.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to my discounted cash flow valuation, at its base case, the net present value of Hasbro is $71.17, meaning, at its current price of $63.75, the company is undervalued by ~10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My model, calculated over 5 years without built-in perpetual growth, assumes a discount rate of 10%, incorporating Hasbro's larger debt levels and higher sensitivity to macro events. Moreover, I projected an average revenue growth rate of 5%, lower than Hasbro's smoothed-out- to account for COVID-19 and subsequent anomalies- trailing 5Y revenue growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911101935738044_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1412\" data-height=\"742\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911101935738044.png\" alt=\"Relative Valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Alpha Spread</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Alpha Spread's multiples-based relative valuation more than corroborates my thesis on undervaluation, estimating a base case undervaluation of 38%, with the company's relative value being $104.64.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, Alpha Spread fails to adequately reflect Hasbro's true value, since the model does not discount growth multiples for dividends and fails to capture Hasbro's higher debt levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As such, using a weighted average of the company's NPV and relative value, skewed towards my DCF, the fair value of Hasbro is $79.23, with the stock undervalued by ~20%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Divestment from eOne &amp; Focus on Big Brands Supports Margin Expansion Efforts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's overall business objective in the medium term remains its efforts to streamline its operations and focus on bigger brand, virtuous cycle-inducing, integrative growth. The sale of Hasbro's eOne film and television segments manifests this sentiment, netting Hasbro $375mn in immediate cash injection and ensuring a laser-focus on core activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Beyond operations, Hasbro has additionally positioned itself for accelerated deleveraging efforts and greater reinvestment into existing brands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911107759729934_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1488\" data-height=\"838\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911107759729934.png\" alt=\"Sale of eOne\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro Q2'23 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And apart from attaining a solid financial position, the key to sustaining it is a level of financial discipline and austerity, which starts with widening the firm's savings base and managing its expense structure. In doing so, Hasbro has managed to reduce the cost to achieve run-rate savings significantly, while increasing said savings structures. On a more granular level, Hasbro has dedicated itself to superior inventory management and reduced overhead related to non-core businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911108853341217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1393\" data-height=\"708\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-16911108853341217.png\" alt=\"Savings Methodology\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro Q2'23 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With these excess cash flows, investors can expect Hasbro to continually invest in core businesses, ensure long-run deleveraging, and return cash flows to investors through a peerless dividend program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110960482556_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1393\" data-height=\"677\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110960482556.png\" alt=\"Cash Flow Management\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro Q2'23 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wall Street Consensus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analysts generally support my positive view of the company, projecting an average 1Y price target of $75.67, a 16.25% interest. This runs alongside general 'strong buy' sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110232247966_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1760\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/3/55504453-1691110232247966.png\" alt=\"Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even at the minimum projected price of $64.00, a 1.67% decline, investors can expect to remain positive due to Hasbro's dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I believe analysts' overall positive sentiment reflects Wall Street's opinion that the market has overreacted to post-COVID financial decline and its durability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Rising Interest Rates Continue to Hamper Cost Base &amp; Demand Levels</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As aforementioned, among industry peers, Hasbro continues to maintain a dependence on debt to finance its activities. As such, with rising interest rates, Hasbro maintains a reduced ability to reinvest or return cash flows to investors. Moreover, as Hasbro's tabletop and digital games remain discretionary spending items, lagging consumer sentiment has resulted in a temporary recession for toy demand.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Long-Run Demand May be on a Downtrend</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Regardless of temporary demand headwinds, Hasbro may be contending with long-run demand declines, as a result of aggressive digitalization of entertainment products and alternative segments experiencing greater growth- such as video gaming and such. Therefore, Hasbro must remain pragmatic in cost management efforts to reduce long-term uncertainties.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the long run, Hasbro aims to become a more streamlined and nimble organization, mindful of its expense base and aggressively promoting its higher margin core business, to the benefit of its impressive dividend program and, thus, investors.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS
