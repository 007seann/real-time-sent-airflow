Today we will try to estimate the fair value of Hasbro's company based on its dividends and its expected dividend growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">First, we will estimate, what is the current expectation by the market, what is the implied dividend growth based on the current share price. The we will be using scenario analysis to see, what price could be justified for different assumptions with regards to growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To answer all these questions, we will be using dividend discount models. But before we start, we have to discuss, why exactly we chose this approach, why we believe it could be suitable, and what the drawbacks are.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend discount models</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As Hasbro's price has fallen significantly in the past 12 months, its dividend yield became quite high, 5.8% to be precise. Such a high yield often catches the attention of dividend and dividend growth investors and for this reason, we decided to evaluate the firm today based solely on its future dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend discount models (DDM) help to determine the fair value of a company by discounting the future dividend payments. These models could be suitable for valuing firms that have shown strong commitment of returning value to their shareholders in the form of dividend payments. Stable and sustainable dividend growth over a long period of time is always a good indication for this. Hasbro fulfills this criteria.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-16792962723870814_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1764\" data-height=\"1316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-16792962723870814.png\" alt=\"screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend history (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has been paying dividends for its shareholders each year in the past 33 years. While they have not always managed to increase these payments, between 2005 and 2020, the payments have increased significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One drawback of the model is that it is more suitable for firms that are relatively unaffected by the fluctuations of the business cycle. Hasbro, as a firm operating in the consumer discretionary space, is likely directly impacted by business cycle and consumer sentiment, which in turn may also influence the dividend policy. But to account for this, we will be using scenario analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now that we understand that Hasbro may be a suitable candidate to be valued by DDMs, we have to highlight the primary assumptions that go into such models. These are: required rate of return and the dividend growth rate assumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For our calculations, for all cases, we are going to keep the required rate of return the same, namely 11%. This corresponds to the firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-16792965692118466_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"936\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-16792965692118466.png\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">WACC (finbox.com)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Implied dividend growth rate</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Implied dividend growth rate is the growth rate that would justify the current market price.

But the 4.9% is still significantly above the growth rate that the firm has managed to achieve in the past 3 - 5 years. Further, the firm's payout ratios are not particularly pointing to dividend safety, and for these reasons, we believe that it is better to look at different growth scenarios, which may be more realistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-1679297540575798_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1758\" data-height=\"1282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/20/56413274-1679297540575798.png\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend safety (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Scenario 1</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For this scenario we will assume that the dividend will grow at a rate of 2.5% in perpetuity, which is about in line with the overall growth of the economy.

We believe that the near term macroeconomic headwinds are likely to improve in the coming years, which could also positively influence Hasbro's financial performance and in turn its dividend growth. Improving consumer confidence, slowing inflation and the decreasing energy prices could all have a positive impact. The question is, when and will Hasbro be able to sustain the dividends until then?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To try to answer this question, we have created another scenario.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Scenario 2</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For this scenario we assume that Hasbro will suspend its dividend for one year, due to the macroeconomic headwinds.
