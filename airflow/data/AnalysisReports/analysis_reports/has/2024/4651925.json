The recent selloff came after what I believe were largely misinterpreted earnings results.</p> <p>The margin expansion, increased operating profit and<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> massive reduction in costs has been ignored by the markets with the significant drop in consumer products and entertainment revenues instead dominating the headlines.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, I believe this selloff has only strengthened the value opportunity potential present in shares with current valuations suggesting the stock may be up for grabs at a 68% discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, I continue to rate Hasbro stock a Strong Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Company Background</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/edfc9064-b222-4449-9d02-a47132bee5e9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hasbro</a> is an American MNC conglomerate headquartered in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The company owns some of the largest toy brands in the world including Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers and Wizards of The Coast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company was founded over 100 years ago and continues to be one of the largest toy manufacturers in the world. Their portfolio of products includes partnerships with huge franchises such as Star Wars, Marvel, Transformers, Furby, Nerf, My Little Pony and even Peppa Pig.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Their immense scale and huge portfolio of brands has left the company with a significant set of valuable tangible and intangible assets which help drive moatiness for the firm\u2019s business operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While their primary competitor Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) is a slightly smaller company, the incredibly competitive nature of the toy industry means Hasbro must continue to innovate and maintain a relevant portfolio of products in order to attract new customers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Economic Moat \u2013 Q3 FY23 Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I conducted a full in-depth analysis on Hasbro\u2019s economic moat back in March 2023 and rated the firm a Strong Buy. I believe that fundamentally, little has changed with regards to the firm\u2019s economic moat or my investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The firm still have the largest and most robust economic moat of any company operating within the toy industry thanks to their unique portfolio consisting of both physical and digital products that market to a wide variety of customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To read a comprehensive analysis into Hasbro\u2019s narrow yet robust economic moat, checkout my article \u201c<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585114-hasbro-good-business-at-an-amazing-price\">Hasbro: Good Business At An Amazing Price</a>\u201d.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In this update article, I would like the discuss Hasbro\u2019s digital product releases, the progress made towards closing the eOne entertainment sale and how the firm is managing Wizards of the Coast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The past quarter saw Hasbro make multiple digital product releases that resonated soundly with both consumers and critics alike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-1699869356235014.png\" alt=\"Hasbro Baldur's Gate 3 Graphic\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro FY23 Q3 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/a2a2197c-0a07-49c8-8506-34ccf3bee347\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> a Dungeons &amp; Dragons themed CRPG computer game titled \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\u201d which sees the company translate one of their most lucrative physical franchises into a truly revolutionary video game.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Critical acclaim for the release has been outstanding with <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review\" rel=\"nofollow\">IGN</a>\u2019s Leana Hafer stating the game sets a new \u201chigh-water mark for the entire genre\u201d of games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This critical and consumer acclaim appears to have translated well into earnings for the firm too with their Wizards of the Coast &amp; Digital gaming segment reporting massive 40% YoY increases in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Some critics suspected that Hasbro may have been mismanaging the Wizards of the Coast franchises due to excessive monetization and some less than stellar product releases. However, I believe Hasbro has righted those mistakes by refocusing on what their core customers enjoy most which fundamentally encompasses the firm\u2019s \u201cRefocusing on Play\u201d turnaround strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998694293246531.png\" alt=\"Monopoly Go Graphic\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro FY23 Q3 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s mobile Monopoly game offering, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.monopolygo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monopoly Go!</a>\u201d, also continues to generate great revenue growth for the firm. The game has been made in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.scopely.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scopely</a> an established mobile game developer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This deal has allowed Hasbro to sell licensing rights to Scopely which generates revenue for Hasbro through royalties due to the firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, the combined successes within Hasbro\u2019s Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segments suggests that this transformative step towards becoming a combined physical toy and media powerhouse has worked well for the firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore, the progress made towards closing the sale of eOne to Lionsgate means Hasbro should be able to complete this deal by the end of the year. The initial concept behind eOne was that Hasbro could produce their film, TV and gaming content inhouse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While this initial belief was misinformed, Hasbro has been quick to admit their mistakes by divesting the business unit and refocusing their digital product strategy on one that revolves around licensing agreement sales and close collaboration with established media powerhouses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I believe this strategy should allow Hasbro to massively outperform the roughly 10% margins the firm was able to extract from the eOne business thanks to the less resource intensive strategy now being pursued by the firm.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Situation \u2013 Q3 FY23 Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s most recent <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/69afb88f-126e-4604-856e-dae9826abbe6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3</a> results delivered a slightly mixed bag of fiscal results which I believe ultimately have been misunderstood by the markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691673235307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"156\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691673235307.png\" alt=\"HAS FY23 Q3 Earnings Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>HAS FY23 Q3 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Adjusted earnings for <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3</a> (due to the negative impacts GAAP accounting methods would inflict on results as a consequence of the eOne divestiture) saw Hasbro\u2019s total revenues fall 10% YoY to just $1.5B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This earnings weakness was due to a massive 18% and 42% drop in revenues YoY from Hasbro\u2019s Consumer Products and Entertainment business segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Consumer Products revenues declined sharply due to a flurry of macroeconomic and competitive headwinds. The resurgence of Mattel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/26/barbie-film-sales-mattel-toy-maker-entertainment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barbie</a> set of dolls and toys has potentially negatively impacted Hasbro\u2019s overall sale of toys due to the currently \u201cin\u201d nature of the pink franchise among consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The increasingly bearish macro conditions currently impacting consumers across the globe has placed a real strain on the amount of disposable income consumers have to spend on toys and non-essential items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">European and Asian markets have been hit particularly hard with the U.S. markets seemingly only being buoyed by credit card <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/credit-card-debt-reached-record-high-means-economy/story?id=104717977\" rel=\"nofollow\">debt</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, the key here is that none of the headwinds responsible for this decline in core consumer product sales was due to failed execution or mismanagement on the part of Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Inevitably, competing brands will occasionally achieve perfected execution of product launches that sees popularity increase in the short-term. Equally, the toy market has always largely been tied to the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, while the drop in earnings from Hasbro\u2019s core business are regrettable, nothing is fundamentally wrong at the firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A similar narrative appears to be present within the firm\u2019s entertainment business with the Hollywood actors and writers strikes of 2023 having led to a whopping 42% drop in revenues YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the resolution of theses strikes has been positive, I believe it may take up to around 4 months for the damage to content pipelines caused by these industry actions the be rectified.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Still, Hasbro is proactively working with their relevant industry partners to ramp-up production of new releases and content to ensure their entertainment business rebounds meaningfully moving into 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691619612103_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"151\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691619612103.png\" alt=\"HAS FY23 Q3 Operating Performance Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>HAS FY23 Q3 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Adjusted operating profit for <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/e4ea25ee-9afa-4e94-9467-443df121a4c7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3</a> FY23 still increased 27% YoY thanks to a favorable product mix of high-margin digital game revenues and lower royalty &amp; operating expenses. The firm has also exceeded their 2023 cost savings target if $150M with total gross savings estimated to currently be around $200M and still increasing as the firm moves towards the end of FY23.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The firm\u2019s operating margin also increased to 22.8% up from just 16.1% in FY22. Fundamentally, despite the falling revenues, Hasbro has become an even more profitable and efficient firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I firmly believe that the core objective for a business is to generate profits, not revenues. Following this line of thought, Hasbro has arguably become an even better business in Q3 FY23 despite the overall consensus from investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691575185149_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"633\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691575185149.png\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha | HAS | Profitability\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha | HAS | Profitability</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Seeking Alpha\u2019s Quant has downgraded Hasbro\u2019s profitability rating to a \u201c<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/profitability\">C</a>\u201d which I believe is an excessively pessimistic representation of the core profitability present at Hasbro given the aforementioned reasons for their drop in revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/balance-sheet\">balance</a> sheets continue to be in healthy shape with the divestiture of their eOne business set to further strengthen their fiscal stability.

YTD shares have fallen a whopping 30% underperforming the U.S. market as a whole by over 45%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the relative valuation provided by simple metrics and ratios along with the absolute comparison certainly appear to suggest Hasbro is currently undervalued, a quantitative value calculation must still be conducted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998691412918136.png\" alt=\"TVC Intrinsic Value Calculation\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Value Corner</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">By utilizing The Value Corner\u2019s specially formulated Intrinsic Valuation Calculation, we can better understand what value exists in the company from a more objective perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">By inputting Hasbro\u2019s current share price of $43.11, an estimated 2024 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/earnings/estimates\">EPS</a> of $4.04, a realistic \u201cr\u201d value of 0.15 (15%) and the current Moody\u2019s Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield ratio of 5.13x into the formula, a base-case IV of $133.40 can be derived.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This would mean a whopping 68% undervaluation in shares is present.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When using a more pessimistic CAGR value for r of just 0.06 (6%) to reflect a scenario where Hasbro struggles to increase revenues and margins due to an acute recession limiting the spending power of consumers, shares are still valued at 40% discount relative to the current price of $43.00.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Considering these valuation metrics, absolute valuation and intrinsic value calculation, I believe Hasbro is trading soundly in Buffett-style fat pitch deep value territory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Warren <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/why-warren-buffet-s-advice-on-holding-cash-and-fat-pitches-is-more-relevant-than-ever/ar-AA1a5DmU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buffett</a> defines fat-pitches as rare, \u201cno-brainer\u201d opportunities which usually present themselves while the rest of the markets are panicking. Considering this definition, Hasbro definitely appears to fit the definition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Still, in the short term (3-12 months), I find it difficult to say exactly what may happen to the stock. While the absolute destruction in shares prices means little downside potential should exist from a logical perspective, markets are inherently irrational mechanisms that sometimes result in illogical valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">An overall souring in investor sentiments regarding the U.S. economy as a whole could also see Hasbro shares struggle to rebound quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the long term (2-10 years), I see Hasbro strengthening their position at the forefront of toy industry. Their large scale, diverse set of hugely popular franchises and brands along with an increasingly lucrative digital presence should allow the firm to outpace its competitors and continue earning outsized returns on their invested capital.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks Facing Hasbro \u2013 Q3 FY23 Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Little change has occurred to the risks racing Hasbro with the possibility for failed execution still remaining the main threat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For a more detailed analysis of the risks facing the firm, I suggest reading my original article <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585114-hasbro-good-business-at-an-amazing-price\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While recent successes from their digital lineup have been excellent to see, Hasbro must continue to accurately target the wants and needs of consumers in order to guarantee long-term growth and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998696835268517_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"296\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/11/13/56776751-16998696835268517.png\" alt=\"Hasbro ESG Banner\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hasbro 2022 ESG Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From an <a href=\"https://cdn.hasbro.com/a280efafc4e294483ab7f2d291426c0c26a4ae4b/c061f04fc40de050b761515e763a2863.pdf#page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">ESG</a> perspective, no tangible change has happened at Hasbro with the firm continuing to generate a positive ESG impact from their operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I still believe Hasbro makes for a great ESG conscious investment but of course recommend you conduct your own analysis into their ESG profile should this be of concern to you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro continues to remain one of my favorite deep-value picks. Their fundamental profitability remains unharmed with the recent Q3 selloff screaming \u201cfat pitch opportunity\u201d to my ears.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The negative market sentiment surrounding their drop in revenues has ignored the adjusted increased in operating profits and margins while entirely discounting the success of recent digital releases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I believe that the most recent Q3 results indicate Hasbro has successfully executed the first stage of their turnaround strategy with dropping costs and expanding margins illustrating this improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A compromised macroeconomic landscape has led to what may initially appear as weak performance which further supports the hypothesis that a fat pitch opportunity may be present in shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is compounded by the potential 68% undervaluation present in the stock.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, I continue to rate Hasbro a Strong Buy and have built a sizable 20% stake in the firm relative to my total portfolio value.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: I See A Real Deep-Value Style Fat-Pitch Opportunity Here. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651925-hasbro-i-see-a-real-deep-value-style-fat-pitch-opportunity-here?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "", "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "106782", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "501643", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "646430", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115452", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "548906", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "142841", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "142871", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115392", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "143021", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "606619", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4651925-hasbro-i-see-a-real-deep-value-style-fat-pitch-opportunity-here", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651925-hasbro-i-see-a-real-deep-value-style-fat-pitch-opportunity-here", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1004357040/image_1004357040.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1004357040/image_1004357040.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1004357040/image_1004357040.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1004357040/image_1004357040.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "106782", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "the-value-corner", "userId": 56776751, "tagId": 646430, "bio": "<p>Buffett-style rational value picks | Top 95th percentile of financial bloggers according to TipRanks.</p><p>Six years of long-horizon investment portfolio management and consulting. </p><p>I do not provide or publish investment advice on Seeking Alpha.
