However, in the following I would like to analyze whether the company is also a buy from a fundamental point of view or not.</p> <h2>Fundamentals</h2> <p><em>Cash return to shareholders</em></p> <p>Hasbro has returned a lot of capital to its shareholders with dividends and share buybacks.</p> <p>Hasbro offers attractive dividends to shareholders. These are the highlights:</p> <ul> <li>payout ratio: 63.31%</li> <li>actual yield: 2.53%</li> <li>five year growth rate: 15.44%</li> <li>dividend growth: 16 Years</li> <li>next ex-dividend date: 07/31/2019</li> </ul> <p>The dividend yield is within the range of the last 10 years.

Nevertheless, with 26% Disney has the lower payout ratio. Disney also has slightly higher dividend growth. </p> <p>In addition to dividends, the Hasbro returns capital to its shareholders through share buybacks. In the past 10 years, Hasbro bought USD 2.5 billion of its shares.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-1560953940732494_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1285\" data-height=\"725\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-1560953940732494.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>(<em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/03d7deae-560e-4f2a-8710-ae23e22e439e\" rel=\"nofollow\">Share repurchases</a>)</p> <p><em>P/E ratio</em></p> <p>The actual P/E ratio is 38.26.

The forward P/B ratio is with 7.78 still very high. The market is therefore currently willing to pay eight times the book price for the company. This is far from the average too. It is even the highest P/B ratio for far more than 10 years. This indicates a strong overvaluation:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-15609505033191314_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"867\" data-height=\"255\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-15609505033191314.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"188\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(<em>Source</em>: <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAS/hasbro/pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">Macrotrends</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Such a high ratio is also not necessarily usual for growth companies in comparable markets. Disney, for example, has a actual P/E ratio of 2.79 and a forward P/E ratio of 2.76. Nevertheless, Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) has a similar actual P/E ratio of 7.6 and a forward P/E ratio of 8.01.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What do you get for these premiums?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The fundamental criteria indicate a high overvaluation. However, this can also be justified, for example if a company has extreme growth potential. And indeed, Hasbro reported better than estimated numbers for the first quarter. The highlights were:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Absent a negative USD 24.3 million impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2019 revenues grew 6%</li> <li>Revenues increased 1% in the U.S. and Canada segment and 24% in the Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment;</li> <li>International segment revenues declined 2%, but increased 6% absent a negative $23.4 million impact of foreign exchange.</li> <li>Franchise Brands revenue increased 9%; Hasbro Gaming up 2%; Emerging Brands up 22%; and Partner Brand revenues declined 14%</li> <li>Operating profit increased to USD 36.1 million or 4.9% of revenues.</li> <li>Net earnings increased to USD 26.7 million or USD 0.21 per diluted share.</li> <li>Quarter ending cash of USD 1.2 billion.</li> <li><p>Hasbro currently holds the license to make toys tied to the Star Wars, Disney Princesses and Frozen franchises. The contract will expire at the end of 2020 but the CEO remains positive and says that the company will extend its partnership with Disney before the contract expires.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Brand and content portfolio</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has a large portfolio of world-famous bands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/20/48342731-15610245463040502_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"885\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/20/48342731-15610245463040502.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"363\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(<em>Source</em>: <a href=\"https://hasbro.gcs-web.com/corporate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brand portfolio</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But such a portfolio alone does not guarantee growth.

In addition, investors will not get a much more profitable company either, which could justify the premium. Yes, Hasbro has a slightly better gross margin than Mattel or Disney but the three companies are not that far away from each other.<span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-15609508208051195_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-15609508208051195.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"232\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(<em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/profitability\">Gross margin</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore, computers and the internet in general also offer a wide range of play activities that go beyond toys. Customer habits have changed accordingly. Of course Hasbro addresses these changes by adapting to the changed habits, especially with the digital launch of its well known brands, like the card game <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Nevertheless, the changing habits of consumers have led the company to face more and more competitors. As a result of digitalization, Activision Blizzard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATVI?s=atvi\">ATVI</a>) is rivaling the <em>Magic: Gathering</em> universe with its <em>Hearthstone</em> game. Amazon is launching its first private label line of toys for toddlers and kids too. Accordingly, the competitive environment has not become simpler. And whether Hasbro can keep up here must first be seen. Compared to card games like <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is clearly the less popular game. At least this is what the Twitch numbers show:<span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/20/48342731-1561029429313537_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"825\" data-height=\"457\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/20/48342731-1561029429313537.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"355\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(<em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/tags/8d39b307-d3ad-4f4a-98a4-d1951f55ceb7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitch</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q2 2019 results as a decisive factor?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro will publish its results for the second quarter on July 23, 2019. In the past 5 years (20Q), Hasbro has missed estimated EPS 5 and estimated revenue 9 times. A miss in estimated EPS came always along with a miss in estimated revenue.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Estimated EPS</td> <td>Estimated Revenue</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Miss</td> <td>5</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Beat</td> <td>15</td> <td>11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chance of miss</td> <td><p>25 %</p></td> <td>45 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chance of beat</td> <td><p>75 %</p></td> <td>55 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Last miss in Q2</td> <td><p>2014</p></td> <td>2014</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/earnings\">Analysis of earning history</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is therefore predominantly probable that Hasbro will beat analysts' expectations. A bet on a beat might therefore be a good idea because a further beat could give the share price the next boost. However, this is risky and goes hand in hand with the acceptance of a pretty high P/E ratio. In that case, I'd wait for the second quarter results. While this could result in a loss of profit potential, I think risk reduction is the more important element.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After every analysis of a company, I use a three-grade rating for this series. Its purpose is to ensure that readers recognize at first glance whether a company might or might not be worth investing. The three steps rating at a glance:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"Buy now rather than tomorrow\" if:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>There are no downsides and the company has growth potential.*</li> <li>The upsides outweigh the downsides and the company has enormous growth potential.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"Worth an investment (maybe later after a second look)\" if:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The upsides outweigh the downsides.</li> <li>The upsides are equal to downsides but the company has growth potential.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"No, thanks\" if:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>No growth potential in the long term.</li> <li>The downsides outweigh the upsides.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">*Of course, the growth potential is part of the upside, but it is also crucial in my final considerations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>The grade for Hasbro:</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After all, I don't think Hasbro is a buy right now. For me, it is a \"no, thanks\" at the moment:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The dividend is pretty good.</li> <li>The valuation is way too high.</li> <li>The competitive environment has not become simpler.</li> <li>While there may be growth potential, I think risk reduction is the more important element at the moment.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest</em> <em>research, click \"Follow\" next to my name at the top of this article, and check \"Get email alerts.\"</em></p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - If Hasbro Was Cheaper, I Would Buy Before The Q2 Results. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4271524-hasbro-was-cheaper-i-buy-q2-results?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "105217", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "46742", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "599131", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4271524-hasbro-was-cheaper-i-buy-q2-results", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4271524-hasbro-was-cheaper-i-buy-q2-results", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-1560948281503711_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/19/48342731-1560948281503711_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "105217", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "the-european-view", "userId": 48342731, "tagId": 599131, "bio": "Runner of the TEV Blog | Private Investor<br><p><br></p><p>I am a long-term oriented investor and in my early thirties.
