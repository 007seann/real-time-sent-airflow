HAS shares just experienced one of their worst trading days of all-time and I\u2019m sure investors are wondering whether or not this well-known name is worth a look here around $100. I\u2019m wondering the same thing myself and in this piece I\u2019ll be taking a close look at the earnings report, conference call, and my prior analysis to update my Hasbro outlook.</p> <p>When my original HAS article was published, shares were trading for $113.50. I wrote this on the heels of a double-digit sell-off that saw the stock fall from the $125 market in late July to ~$111 or so in the first week of August. The stock hovered in the $110-115 range for a few weeks in early August before taking another leg down to the $105 area on 8/23/19. The second leg of the sell-off was inspired by M&amp;A news. On 8/22 HAS announced that it was making a $4b all-cash purchase of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3494332-toy-stocks-slump-on-china-news-big-acquisition\">Entertainment One</a>. Cash leaving the balance sheet is generally viewed as a negative thing by investors and I wasn\u2019t surprised to see the stock experienced added weakness. Around this point in time, I thought that I might have a chance to pick up shares around the $80 price target that I highlighted in my original article. Yet, as sentiment related to the trade war improved in September and October, HAS shares rose alongside it (the company has previously mentioned the trade war/tariffs as a significant headwind and any relief here was viewed as a major positive by the market). Prior to the Q3 sell-off, shares had risen above the $120 level.
