(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) announced it was acquiring Entertainment One Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENTMF\">ENTMF</a>) through an all-cash deal worth approximately USD$4.0 billion. Hasbro will gain access to popular properties like Peppa Pig and Ricky Zoom, along with substantial TV production capabilities. Peppa Pig is very popular in the UK, China, and elsewhere while Ricky Zoom is steadily gaining traction worldwide. We see this deal as Hasbro\u2019s way of finally being able to produce its own live-action and animated TV shows and movies in-house, versus being forced to license out its intellectual property (such as Transformers) to studios.</p> <p>Hasbro sees its long-term future resting in large part on the ability to make video-streaming content and video games (with an eye towards mobile apps) based on properties that already have substantial fan bases. As HAS trades at the upper end of our fair value range (derived through our rigorous <a href=\"https://www.valuentum.com/categories/20110615\" rel=\"nofollow\">discounted free cash flow analysis</a>), we aren\u2019t interested in shares, especially as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tariffs/trump-delays-tariffs-on-chinese-cellphones-laptops-toys-markets-jump-idUSKCN1V31CX\" rel=\"nofollow\">additional US tariffs</a> on Chinese toy imports are set to kick in this December. While that\u2019s after the main spending period of the 2019 holiday shopping season, the fear is that those tariffs will still be on pace for 2020, 2021, etc., which negatively impacts Hasbro\u2019s longer-term outlook. Shares of HAS yield 2.5% as of this writing.</p> <p>The toymaker has had <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/cee88521-71dc-4b58-89bd-7adb7bb04b84\" rel=\"nofollow\">plenty of success</a> leveraging its Transformers property, largely through licensing agreements. Its 2018 movie Bumblebee grossed over $460 million at the box office, including over $170 million in China. That's on top of ~$30 million in DVD and Blue-ray sales, versus a production budget <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Bumblebee#tab=more\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated</a> around $100 million keeping marketing expenses in mind. In partnership with Paramount, owned by Viacom Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIAB\">VIAB</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/cbs-viacom-have-different-streaming-strategies-can-they-combine-win-n1042701\" rel=\"nofollow\">soon</a> CBS Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PARA\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CBS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">), Hasbro plans to continue making blockbuster Transformers movies. It's key to note that these movies create interest in Hasbro's toy products and other video offerings (such as animated TV shows), enhancing its revenue generation elsewhere.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is investing in additional Transformers content, including producing a new animated TV show for the Chinese market (in conjunction with a local partner) which will be supported by a new line of Transformers toys and related products. Hasbro is also rolling out new content for preschoolers and pre-adolescent children in Western markets, including Transformers: Rescue Bots Academy (first launched late-2018/early-2019) and Transformers: Cyberverse (first season launched in 2018, second season planned for later in 2019).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking ahead, Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) and Hasbro are working together on a new animated series, Transformers: The War for Cybertron Trilogy, that is guided for a 2020 launch. The purchase of Entertainment One isn\u2019t a shift in a new direction, it\u2019s a continuation of what Hasbro has been steadily building towards for a while now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Deal Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is suspending its share buyback program as part of this deal in order to deleverage the balance sheet while maintaining its dividend policy. A combination of debt and a $1.0-$1.25 billion equity issuance are expected to help finance the deal, keeping in mind Hasbro was sitting on $1.15 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in total debt at the <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-revenue-and-operating-profit-growth-second\" rel=\"nofollow\">end</a> of June 2019. The lower interest rate environment the world now faces makes it much easier for Hasbro to raise meaningful amounts of funds from capital markets at reasonable rates. Down below is a key excerpt from Hasbro\u2019s <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-acquire-entertainment-one-adding-brands-and-expanding\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a>;</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p> </p> <p>The cash purchase price of \u00a35.60 per share represents a 31% premium to eOne\u2019s 30-day volume-weighted average price [VWAP] as of August 22, 2019. Hasbro expects to finance the transaction with the proceeds of debt financing and approximately US$1.0 billion to US$1.25 billion in cash from equity financing. Hasbro has entered into a debt commitment letter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility to secure funding of the purchase price.</p> <p>Hasbro is committed to maintaining an investment grade rating. Hasbro\u2019s long-term leverage target remains unchanged at 2.00 to 2.50X gross Debt to EBITDA and expects to return to this range in three to four years. Hasbro expects to maintain its quarterly dividend and suspend its current share repurchase program while it prioritizes achieving its leverage target.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We caution Hasbro\u2019s net debt position will be growing materially after the deal closes. Considering Hasbro\u2019s strong free cash flows and plans to deleverage, management should be able to bring down the toy maker\u2019s leverage considerably within a few years. Future dividend increases will need to contend with debt reduction efforts that also consume free cash flows, which will likely depress payout growth in the medium term. Hasbro expects the deal to close by the end of 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management has their eyes set on ~$130 million in cost and in-sourcing synergies by 2022, with room for upside via revenue synergies. While this deal is largely to grow Hasbro\u2019s IP portfolio and ability to produce video content (TV, movies, short-clips, etc.), synergies are a nice cherry on top and modestly enhance expected future free cash flows (on an absolute basis).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What We Think</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past three fiscal years (FY2016\u2013FY2018), Hasbro generated ~$0.7 billion in net operating cash flow per year on average. As its business model is light on capital expenditures relatively speaking, which we appreciate, Hasbro\u2019s free cash flows averaged ~$0.6 billion per year during this period. That easily covered ~$0.3 billion in average annual dividend payouts. With share repurchases halted (averaged ~$0.2 billion per year from FY2016\u2013FY2018), the remainder of Hasbro\u2019s free cash flows can now be allocated to paying down debt. Here\u2019s a quick summary of our thoughts on the leisure industry, from our 16-page Stock Report covering Hasbro:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The leisure industry is composed of firms that span the cruise line business to those that make toys and children\u2019s products. Competition among toy companies is intensifying due to recent trends toward shorter toy life cycles, the increasing use of technology in toys, and the proliferation of electronic consumer products and video games. All industry participants compete for consumer discretionary income. We\u2019re neutral on the structure of the group.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Additionally, please note that Hasbro has a history of generating strong returns for shareholders, seen through the firm\u2019s return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) exceeding its estimated weighted-average cost of capital over the past three full fiscal years. That\u2019s highlighted in the graphic below, which is also from our 16-page Stock Report covering Hasbro:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668646889095476_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"920\" data-height=\"802\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668646889095476.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Image Shown: Hasbro\u2019s ROIC ex-goodwill has consistently exceeded its estimated WACC over the past three full fiscal years, and we expect that to continue going forward (based on our rigorous pro forma financial analysis). Image Source: From our 16-page Stock Report covering Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We see Hasbro\u2019s net operating cash flows steadily increasing over the next five years and beyond, allowing for meaningful free cash flow growth. The company\u2019s push deeper into the TV and movie production space over the next few years will play a key role in determining the trajectory of Hasbro\u2019s free cash flows, as will management's ability to properly leverage Hasbro's new top tier IP (with an eye on Peppa Pig and Ricky Zoom). In the graphic down below we highlight how we view the trajectory of Hasbro\u2019s net operating cash flows and free cash flows, which is also from our 16-page Stock Report covering Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668647668989024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1110\" data-height=\"698\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668647668989024.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668647925639389_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1110\" data-height=\"701\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668647925639389.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"404\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Images Shown: We expect Hasbro to post meaningful cash flow growth over the next five fiscal years and beyond. Image Source: From our 16-page Stock Report covering Hasbro</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Concluding Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We are still staying on the sidelines as we see Hasbro facing some significant exogenous shocks in the near term, namely US tariffs on Chinese toy imports (which are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/07/business/china-tariffs-toys/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">especially onerous</a> in light of America receiving ~85% of its toy imports from China), while shares of HAS are already fully valued in our view. Hasbro\u2019s foray into the TV and movie production business makes perfect sense as the company\u2019s IP is in high demand. Acquiring the Peppa Pig and to a lesser extent the Ricky Zoom properties substantially enhances Hasbro\u2019s international growth trajectory, if the company plays its cards right.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS $ENTMF-DEFUNCT-24018 - Hasbro Makes Big Push Into Video Production, But We Are Still On The Sidelines. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4288426-hasbro-makes-big-push-video-production-are-still-on-sidelines?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24491", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "62858", "type": "sentiment"}, {"id": "62857", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "24018", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "34650", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4288426-hasbro-makes-big-push-video-production-are-still-on-sidelines", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4288426-hasbro-makes-big-push-video-production-are-still-on-sidelines", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668398796507106_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/26/933684-15668398796507106_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "24491", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "valuentum", "userId": 933684, "tagId": 34650, "bio": "<p>We offer subscriptions and exclusive newsletters.
