The results were well below expectations, missing both on top and bottom lines: The company posted EPS of USD 1.33 vs. consensus estimates of USD 1.68 (-42% YOY), while the actual revenue amounted to USD 1,389m vs. analysts-estimated USD 1,534m (-13% YOY).</p> <p>Moreover, the company's margins fell sharply with operating margin decreasing by 920bps compared to the 3rd quarter.</p> <p>According to management, the weak revenues reflect loss from Toys\"R\"Us streamlined throughout 2018 in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific, as well as a more meaningful impact than expected from the liquidation of Toys\"R\"Us inventory into these markets.</p> <h2>The Story</h2> <p>2018 was a very disruptive year for toy retailers, driven by the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys\"R\"Us and the struggling of Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>). The toy retail environment is changing dramatically, with consumers spending more time in front of their TVs and mobile screens rather than playing with their toys. The result of this change in consumer behavior is a rapidly evolving retail landscape and reduced retail inventory. In that manner, HAS is under heavy pressure and has no choice but doing the necessary adjustments in order to keep its growth narrative alive. Some of these adjustments have already been discussed by management during the earnings release. Among them are diversification of its retails base, operational and organizational changes, lowering of retailer inventories, and delivering of innovative new offerings to its consumers. However, I believe that the most important step would be shifting from its core business as a toy retailer into a content producer and franchiser, so the company will be able to take advantage of its great IP catalog and bring its moats to the table. In other words, HAS should strive for being like Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) rather than<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> staying at the retail playground. That is exactly what Mattel is trying to do these days, although the story of MAT is much more complicated.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496603366797357_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1968\" data-height=\"1161\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496603366797357.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"378\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span>I think the encouraging part from HAS earnings release was the increase in Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues, mainly resulting from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro television programming. The company should keep this growing momentum by leveraging its filmed entertainment business and investing heavily in its content arm (Hasbro Studios) and film label (Allspark Pictures), as well as its digital gaming department after the recent launch of Game Magic: The Gathering Arena. By doing so, HAS will raise its chances to see a brighter future and even being an M&amp;A target, which is an option I wouldn't rule out. Let's remember that HAS remains in a strong financial position with the ability to continue investing to drive profitable long-term growth. As of FQ42018, the company's debt to equity amounted at only 5% while holding USD 1.18b in cash and equivalents. That leaves room for future M&amp;A transactions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As of this date, shares of HAS are trading at 23% off their highs, recorded in July 2017. At USD 88.7 per share, and considering FY2019 EPS consensus estimates of USD 3.85, we derive a TTM price to earnings multiple of 23x vs. 5-year average P/E of 27x. Considering the many challenges the company is facing right now, I think the risk/reward profile is unattractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Trying to discount future cash flows by using quite optimistic assumptions of forward 5-year revenue CAGR of 2.5% and operating margin of 15% of total revenue (well above the 7.2% recorded in FY18 and back to FY17 levels), we derive an intrinsic value of USD 73 per share, which is 18% lower than last closing price. That being said, many things can change the company's growth narrative (see above), so one should take the aforementioned calculation with a grain of salt. Presented below is a DCF analysis as derived by using a 9% discount rate, sided by a sensitivity table.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496601385065372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1506\" data-height=\"1041\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496601385065372.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"442\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"442\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">FQ42018 results confirm that the toy industry is changing dramatically. HAS is facing some great headwinds. Among them are changes in consumer behavior and reduced retail inventory. It seems like management is well aware of these problems and makes some moves in the right direction, although there is still a lot of work to be done.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Just to make it clear, the toys industry is not going to disappear, and HAS still holds a leading position within the industry with its great lineup of products. The company has a strong financial position and a solid dividend policy after management announced an increase of 8% in dividend (to $0.68 per share). However, there is still a long way to go in order to turn back to growth mode, and even at 20% off their highs, the downside is still meaningful. At current levels, I believe that Hasbro's risk/reward profile is unattractive and will wait for a steep decline in order to initiate any buying position.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Core Business Is Struggling, Risk/Reward Profile Is Unattractive. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4239841-hasbros-core-business-is-struggling-risk-reward-profile-is-unattractive?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "103683", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "7582", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1748", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "576841", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4239841-hasbros-core-business-is-struggling-risk-reward-profile-is-unattractive", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4239841-hasbros-core-business-is-struggling-risk-reward-profile-is-unattractive", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496603366797357_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/2/8/41336256-15496603366797357_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "103683", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "zvika-finkelstein", "userId": 41336256, "tagId": 576841, "bio": "Specializes particularly in the fields of business modeling and financial reporting analysis.
