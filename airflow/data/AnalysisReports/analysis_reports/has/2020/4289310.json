The toy company decided to become a little more serious about entering the Hollywood industry by purchasing Entertainment One (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENTMF\">ENTMF</a>). The production company/independent studio has access to a library/content portfolio that contains significant brand equity, something that will help Hasbro move beyond its reliance on the Transformers franchise.</p> <p>The eOne purchase also helps the company navigate a post-Toys \"R\" Us, online shopping centered world by adding more opportunities for merchandising. It didn't come at a cheap cost - $4 billion is a lot of money. Nevertheless, I believe that management was wise to finally make an acquisition in this area. I also believe the purchase will add value over time for shareholders, although I do acknowledge that the risk is on proper management of the asset - i.e., don't let Hollywood push you around.</p> <p>I offer three opportunities Hasbro now possesses with eOne, and will discuss them here in brief:</p> <ul> <li>The company now has more valuable brands in its portfolio.</li> <li>The filmed-entertainment aspect provides a more direct avenue into original content and it allows management to more easily control production.</li> <li>The company can expand into collectibles for adults based off the library asset.</li> </ul> <p>While I would have rather seen the company acquire <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2130095-hasbro-dreamworks-deal-fizzles\">DreamWorks Animation</a> a few years back, the company can look at something like eOne as a good alternative option. Furthermore, I do not believe Hasbro is done acquiring Hollywood concerns, although one would presume any in the short term would be smaller in nature.</p> <h2>Additional Brands Available To Hasbro</h2> <p>There are two main toy brands that will be of use to Hasbro over time: Peppa Pig and PJ Masks.
