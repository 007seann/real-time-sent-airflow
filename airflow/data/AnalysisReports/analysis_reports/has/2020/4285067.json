For those of you who don\u2019t play Magic the Gathering, Leyline of the Void is a playing card. That might not mean anything to you and that\u2019s okay. Graveyard hate is not important to this piece. But, if you\u2019re reading this, I assume you\u2019re either a Hasbro shareholder or interested in becoming one, so whether you know it or not, Magic the Gathering is very important to you. This decades old card game was recently ported over into the digital world and its success has helped to drive Hasbro\u2019s recent rally. But, is this success sustainable?</p> <p>The popularity of the digital version of the card game has increased sales of physical cards, creating a bit of a virtuous cycle for HAS. Although I spend more money on HAS products than I care to admit, I\u2019ve never seriously considered owning the stock. The toy space seems rather dead to me. Action figures and board games are so 20<sup>th</sup> century, right? Investing is all about the future. I assumed that faltering demand would lead to negative sales growth which would eventually put HAS\u2019s dividend in jeopardy. Well, looking at the company\u2019s recent results, I may have been wrong. In this piece, I want to take a close look at Hasbro and its fundamentals to see whether or not this company famous for brands like Monopoly, G.I. Joe, My Little Pony, and Nerf guns has what it takes to deserve a spot in my dividend growth portfolio.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/5/5939041-15649875091974301_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"644\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/5/5939041-15649875091974301.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"363\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4276612-hasbro-inc-2019-q2-results-earnings-call-slides\">HAS Q2 CC Presentation Slides, page 4</a></p> <h2><strong>Dividend History</strong></h2> <p>First things first, let\u2019s take a look</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro: This Best In Class Toy Company Is Expensive. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4285067-hasbro-this-best-in-class-toy-company-is-expensive?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>If you enjoyed this content and want to see more like it, please check out my Marketplace service: <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_656\">The Dividend Growth Club</a></strong>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>DGC members have access to <strong>sample portfolios</strong> spanning different dividend yield thresholds, <strong>weekly Nick's Picks</strong> articles, highlighting the best DGI values I see in the market, <strong>real-time</strong> access to Nick's Portfolio and <strong>trade updates</strong>, and a vibrant chat room where an income oriented community has come together to share ideas.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>DGC members also receive <strong>early access</strong> to all other content that I post on Seeking Alpha</p><p>Feel free to take advantage of a\u00a0<strong>free trial</strong>\u00a0offer!</p>", "marketingBullet": "This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, The Dividend Growth Club . <a href='/checkout?service_id=mp_656' sasource='mp_marketing_text_top'>Start your free trial today \u00bb</a>", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I'm Nicholas Ward, a financial analyst covering dividend growth stocks.
