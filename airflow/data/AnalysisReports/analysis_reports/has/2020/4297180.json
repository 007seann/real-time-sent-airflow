The 96 year-old company is best known for manufacturing toys and board games, and most of its revenue is still derived from this business line. However, Hasbro's brand portfolio remains an underdeveloped asset in terms of movie deals and television programming. I think there is a strong chance that a major media company could acquire all or part of the Hasbro business.</p> <h2>Hasbro's New Business Line</h2> <p>Over the last five years, Hasbro has leveraged its strong brands to create a significant new revenue stream. The company's entertainment and licensing division is centered around developing television and movie deals based on toys and games like <em>Transformers</em>, <em>My Little Pony</em>, and <em>Magic: The Gathering.</em> Segment operating profit grew from $45 million in 2013 to <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/cee88521-71dc-4b58-89bd-7adb7bb04b84\" rel=\"nofollow\">$100 million</a> (adjusted) in 2018, a CAGR of over 17 percent.</p> <p>Although Entertainment and Licensing contributes just 12 percent of the company's bottom line, the segment is significantly more profitable with a 34 percent operating margin. Sales of domestic toys and games delivered an operating margin of 19 percent in 2018, while the international toy division came to 10 percent. The Entertainment and Licensing segment is also growing rapidly. Revenues have compounded reliably at 9 percent over the last few years, while sales of toys and games are somewhat cyclical and have been impacted by the recent bankruptcy of Toys R Us and changes in distribution channels.</p> <h2>Why Big Media Could Be Interested</h2> <p>The growth of Hasbro's newfound fortune has coincided with the toymaker's repeated efforts to buy a major movie studio. Hasbro came <a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/hasbro-said-to-end-talks-to-take-over-dreamworks-animation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">close</a> to merging with DreamWorks in 2014, and the company was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/features/lionsgate-sale-merger-shares-1202711913/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportedly interested</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in acquiring Lions Gate (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LGF.A\" title=\"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">LGF.A</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) in 2017.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think the interest could easily go the other way, with a major movie studio buying out all or part of Hasbro for its intellectual property. This has already happened several times over the last decade. Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox, and Warner Brothers are a few of the major entertainment companies that have been acquired since 2009 by larger companies. The first three are now owned by The Walt Disney Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disney is a logical buyer for Hasbro. The toymaker's family-friendly brands would be a good fit for Disney's existing portfolio. Disney is also in a better position to unlock the full potential of Hasbro's brands. Hasbro has struggled with this task at times. The 2000 film production of the popular <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> game bombed at the box office. Although a reboot is in the works, it has been stuck in development since at least 2015. Hasbro and Disney have longstanding business ties going back to the 1950s, with the former licensing Disney brands to produce toys and games. The synergies seem fairly obvious.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) might also be interested. The streaming giant is already working on an animated series for <em>Magic: The Gathering.</em> Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is another wildcard buyer. The retailer is now a major player in the battle for original content with its Prime streaming service. With Toys R Us vanquished, it could also take a more direct role in toy distribution.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even with the earnings hit caused by the collapse of Toys R Us, Wall Street seems confident that the company will find new distribution channels. Hasbro is valued at 60 times earnings today, but that is equivalent to about 31 times its 2016 net income. I don't think that makes Hasbro's valuation cheap, but it seems fair. Then again, a major content creator might pay a big premium for the prospect of leveraging the Hasbro portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although a Hasbro deal would seem like an unusual play for a media company, it makes a lot of sense when one considers Hasbro's stable of iconic toy brands. The <em>Transformers</em> and <em>My Little Pony</em> toy lines have already been successfully adapted for the big screen and television programming. It seems likely that a potential buyer would keep the intellectual property and spin out the toy manufacturing business into a separate company.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro, of course, may desire to stay independent. By all appearances, the company is positioning itself as an integrated toy manufacturer and content creator for film and television. There may come a day, though, when it no longer makes sense for Hasbro to run both a high-margin content division and a relatively low-margin manufacturing division.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Could A Media Company Buy Hasbro?
