So do their consequences. While your brother shooting you in the face with a NERF gun might have nerved your racks as a kid, it was only preparing you for the emotional toll which can be taken while managing your portfolio. The stakes are a lot higher when managing your portfolio than they are when engaging in a NERF gun shoot-out. This time round, your wealth in retirement is at stake.

Is it such a big deal? Many investors use the earnings payout ratio as a proxy for dividend safety, and management may use it to guide further dividend hikes. But dividends are paid out of cashflow, not earnings and as such cashflow payout ratios are more significant. And Hasbro generates bags of cash every year. Over the last 5 years, dividends have remained between 40% and 80% of FCF, indicating that the company can afford the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS can pay its interest 5 times, which is better than 55% of stocks. Usually we consider than anything about 6-7x interest coverage is super safe. At 5x Hasbro is very similar to the median U.S. dividend stock. This level isn\u2019t dangerous, and shouldn\u2019t reduce Hasbro\u2019s dividend safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking at payout &amp; coverage ratios together would suggest that HAS\u2019s dividend is safe.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's dividend yield of 2.44% is better than 50% of dividend stocks. For me to consider stocks with yields between 2 and 2.5%, I\u2019m looking for double digit dividend growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/6/29440305-1565087032055294.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"250\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: mad-dividends.com</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This last year, the dividend grew 8% which is slightly lower than their 5 year CAGR of 10%.

Management have repeated that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4276612-hasbro-inc-2019-q2-results-earnings-call-slides\">dividend growth is a priority</a>. If the company follows through on its plans for licencing and entertainment, it could continue to increase the dividend at a 8-12% growth rate for upcoming years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The combination of the data presented above gives HAS a dividend strength score of 65 / 100.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dividend is quite safe. Not the best covered, but far from being at risk. The combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential is a bit lower than I\u2019d expect for a stock yielding 2.4%, a historically high yield for Hasbro.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Stock Strength</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For me to consider investing in Hasbro, the potential for capital appreciation should be really good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019ll look at value, momentum, financial strength and earnings quality to assess Hasbro\u2019s potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Value</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A first glance at Hasbro\u2019s PE would make the stock look super expensive at 45x trailing earnings. However this is mostly due to a non operating loss due to the settlement of a pension liability. From the 10-Q\u2019s footnote:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Upon settlement of the pension liability, which occurred in May, 2019, the Company recognized a non-OPERATING settlement charge of $110,777 related to pension losses, reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other (income) expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, adjusted for market conditions and settlement costs at benefit distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If we exclude this and look towards the forward PE, HAS would trade at closer to 25x earnings.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>HAS has a P/E of 45.77x</li> <li>P/S of 2.96x</li> <li>P/CFO of 18.69x</li> <li>Dividend yield of 2.44%</li> <li>Buyback yield of 2.79%</li> <li>Shareholder yield of 5.23%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These values would suggest that HAS is more undervalued than 53% of stocks, which would suggest that while not exceedingly overvalued, the stock seems fully priced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, the buybacks complement the dividend nicely, and at a 5.23% shareholder yield, I\u2019m willing to overlook the fact that the dividend yield is slightly lower than I\u2019d have liked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All in all, HAS seems fairly valued at current prices, although towards the expensive of what can be considered a \u201cfair\u201d price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Value Score: 53 / 100</strong></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Momentum</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's price has increased 6.36% these last 3 months, 21.76% these last 6 months &amp; 11.94% these last 12 months and now currently sits at $111.51. The stock\u2019s potential has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by a comfortable margin over the past 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, as you can see in the last quarter of 2018, the stock actually did worse than the market. This shows that the stock might not hold up as well in times of turbulence as it did 12 years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/6/29440305-15650870319812653.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"250\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: mad-dividends.com</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nonetheless, HAS has better momentum than 87% of stocks, which I find to be very encouraging. If this market still has any steam, Hasbro\u2019s price could continue to outperform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Momentum score: 87 / 100 </strong></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Strength</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS' Debt/Equity ratio of 1.9 is better than 41% of stocks. Hasbro's liabilities have decreased by -1% this last year. Operating cashflow can cover 22.3% of HAS's liabilities, which sets the stock in the top quartile for liability coverage. These ratios would suggest that Hasbro has better financial strength than 82% of stocks. And it is true, Hasbro has a fair level of gearing, the company\u2019s liabilities aren\u2019t increasing despite revenues going higher. Hasbro\u2019s financial strength is among the best in the consumer discretionary sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Financial Strength Score: 82/100 </strong></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Earnings Quality</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -11.0% puts it ahead of 60% of stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">132.5% of HAS's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 58% of stocks. Each dollar of HAS's assets generates $0.9 of revenue, putting it ahead of 72% of stocks. Based on these findings, HAS has higher earnings quality than 80% of stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Here as well, Hasbro\u2019s fundamentals don\u2019t disappoint. The high amount of negative accruals, the efficient asset base and the healthy levels of depreciation should be accretive to earnings in upcoming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Earnings Quality Score: 80 / 100 </strong></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Stock Strength Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 96 / 100 which is very satisfying. It is rare to find a stock with Hasbro\u2019s financial strength, earnings quality and momentum which isn\u2019t extremely overvalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investors get a 5% shareholder yield from the stock, which is higher than most in the stock\u2019s sector. The above average fundamentals make Hasbro a great pick to have within the sector.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a dividend strength score of 65 &amp; a stock strength of 96, Hasbro is a decent choice for dividend investors. While we don\u2019t expect consumer discretionary stocks to outperform the market in the next recession, I do expect Hasbro to do better than the average stock in the sector. I would only advise purchasing Hasbro at current prices if you\u2019re rotating out of a consumer discretionary position.Liked this article?
