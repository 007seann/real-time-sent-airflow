The company performed well so far this year driven by a popular brand portfolio. Hasbro has executed well on its strategy. Let's take a look to see what's going on with Hasbro.</p> <p><strong>Revenue and net income increased</strong></p> <p>Hasbro increased its revenue and net income 6% and 57% respectively so far this year. The boys and girls segments contributed to overall revenue growth by increasing 20% and 9% respectively. The games and preschool segments declined 4% and 5% so far this year respectively serving as a drag on overall growth. Geographically, Hasbro's international segment contributed the most to net income gains growing 28% year-to-date. Moreover, long-term debt refinancing announced on May 13, contributed to a decline in interest expense pushing net income higher.</p> <p>Hasbro is executing well on its brand <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/3565360633x0x787179/0734df30-eda2-4b68-a781-fc4d6c91e50d/Hasbro_Q3_2014_Earnings_Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">blueprint</a> strategy which in a nutshell means that it's taking its brands and utilizing them in many different ways such as television shows, movies, games, websites, amusement parks, and international expansion. Part of the international expansion can be traced back to <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> which saw $1 billion in box office receipts this year with 77% coming from international markets. Blockbusters create an \"immersive experience\" and that compels consumers to buy more toys like Transformers. Moreover, Hasbro is planning a new reimagined Transformers television series that will keep its audience engaged between movies. Hasbro also <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/3565360633x0x787254/ec962d17-b733-41d7-86c2-6fdd5edc2080/Hasbro_Q3_14_Earnings_Management_Remarks.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched</a> its second My Little Pony movie in the U.S. on Sept. 27 <em>My Little Pony Equestria Girls Rainbow Rocks</em> which saw box office sales that exceeded the first movie by 37%.</p> <p><strong>Free cash flow declined</strong></p> <p>While things look fine on the revenue and net income fronts free cash flow declined. Negative free cash flow expanded 66% going from negative $31 million this time in 2013 to<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> negative $51 million so far in 2014. Operating cash flow declined 43% due to unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. While cash flow data is limited in the earnings announcement, an inventory buildup for the holiday season probably contributed heavily to the decline in free cash flow. Capital expenditures actually remained roughly even vs. the same time last year. Hasbro is counting on the holiday season to seal 2014 as a successful year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Okay balance sheet</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro sports an okay balance sheet. Its $452 million in cash and equivalents registered at 30% of stockholder's equity. However, its long-term debt position worsened. Long-term debt creates interest which chokes out profitability and cash flow over the long-term. Hasbro increased its long-term debt 63%. Hasbro's long-term debt to equity ratio stood at a whopping 104% of stockholder's equity in the most recent quarter vs. 63% the same time last year. I prefer companies with long-term debt to equity ratios of 50% or less. While part of this is due to <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=847584\" rel=\"nofollow\">refinancing</a> that actually reduced interest expense, a debt appetite can ruin a company if it continues, especially when tempted by low interest rates. This is a metric worth watching with this company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividend is sustainable</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The best way to gauge dividend sustainability is to compare how much a company pays out in dividends relative to free cash flow. Last year, Hasbro paid out 54% of its free cash flow in dividends. So far this year, Hasbro has paid out 8% more per share in dividends giving shareholders $1.29 per share to date. Hasbro's current annual rate of $1.72 per share equates to a yield of 3.0%. Hopefully, the dividend payout ratio will be in the reasonable range if the holiday season works out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is good at adapting and reinventing its brands on a periodic basis in an effort to cater to new generations of consumers. Over the long-term expect Hasbro to reimagine its brands in every medium. Expansion into emerging markets will continue to be successful as children around the world are introduced to Transformers and My Little Pony. Hasbro deserves a long-term spot in your portfolio.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Transformers Lead The Way In Hasbro's Q3 2014 Earnings. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2596065-transformers-lead-the-way-in-hasbros-q3-2014-earnings?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70315", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "164425", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2596065-transformers-lead-the-way-in-hasbros-q3-2014-earnings", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2596065-transformers-lead-the-way-in-hasbros-q3-2014-earnings", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "70315", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "william-bias", "userId": 6009511, "tagId": 164425, "bio": "<p>I have been analyzing stocks since 1992.</p><p></p><p></p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/006/009/511/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "William Bias", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2012, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 347}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "6009511", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "783346", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783356", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783366", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "783376", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias", "profileUrl": "/author/william-bias", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "164425", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "william-bias", "name": "William Bias", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/william-bias"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "earnings", "name": "Earnings", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/earnings"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
