I will provide my view on the financial results of the company and the balance sheet. Thereafter I will briefly discuss the outlook for Hasbro which will result in my investment thesis at the end of this article.</p> <p><b>My view on the financial results</b></p> <p>For the financial year 2013, Hasbro reported a <a href=\"https://files.shareholder.com/downloads/HAS/2950950842x0x724543/c551ebbf-6d90-40ed-9203-cfd47b0ff2db/HAS_News_2014_2_10_Quarterly_Financials.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">total revenue of $4.08B</a>, which is almost exactly the same as in FY 2012 (-0.17%). Unfortunately, the company's operating expenses increased compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly caused by higher royalty payments (up 12.2%) and a 3% increase in selling distribution and administration costs. This is the main reason why the operating cash income decreased by more than 15% to $463M. As the expenses increased on a flat revenue, the operating margin obviously decreased as well, to 11.4% coming from 13.5% in the same period last year.</p> <p>The lower operating profit (and higher interest bill) had a direct impact on the net profit, which tumbled to $286.2M from $336M (-14.8%).</p> <p><em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/12881201-13920558584734018-The-Investment-Doctor_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/12881201-13920558584734018-The-Investment-Doctor.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></em></p> <p>As most of my subscribers know, I also like to have a look at the cash<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> flow statements of a company, as I believe these statements give a better view of the quality and profitability of the underlying business.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the entire year 2013, Hasbro recorded an operating cash flow of $401.1M and an outflow of $217.7M. As the capital expenditures were limited to 'just' $112M, Hasbro reports a free cash flow of $289M, which is much lower than last year's free cash flow which totaled almost $423M. The free cash flow yield this year was just 4.2%, which is below my minimum standards of 5%. However, if one excludes the changes in working capital, the free cash flow yield was approximately $402M, which is a more comfortable starting point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/12881201-13920558740795364-The-Investment-Doctor.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">54% of the free cash flow was used to pay out the quarterly dividend (which has now been raised to $0.43/quarter) and another 35% was used to repurchase 2.3 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>My view on the balance sheet</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moving over to the balance sheet, Hasbro had a working capital position of $1.1B, which is quite healthy considering the total market capitalization of just $6.9 billion. At the end of FY 2013, Hasbro had a current ratio of 1.82, which is also very decent (keep in mind a ratio higher than one means the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/12881201-13920558892691343-The-Investment-Doctor_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/12881201-13920558892691343-The-Investment-Doctor.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The book value for Hasbro was $12.97/share, which means that the company is currently trading at approximately four times its book value, which is relatively expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Outlook</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company does not provide an official outlook, but in this paragraph I'll try to shed my light about the future of Hasbro. I hope the company will be able to get its costs back under control, and together with a slight revenue increase over the next few years (at 1.5-2% per year) this should lead to an increase of the free cash flow. I am targeting a free cash flow of $415M in 2014 and $425M in 2015. As Hasbro will continue to repurchase shares, a free cash flow of $425M divided over 120M outstanding shares results in a free cash flow of $3.54/share in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Investment Thesis</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As I usually use a free cash flow yield to determine whether or not to invest in a company, a cutoff point using a 7.5% free cash flow yield for Hasbro would be $47/share. This doesn't mean the company is currently extremely overvalued, it just means that if I would want a free cash flow yield of 7.5% in 2015 (based on my own assumptions), I would only be allowed to pay $47/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A possible solution and potential trade might be to write a P45 option with an expiry date in January 2015. As the current option premium would be $2.15, this trade would result in an annualized return of 4.99%. If I would be able to buy Hasbro at $45/share, my free cash flow yield in 2015 would be close to 7.9%.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Disclosure: </strong>I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
