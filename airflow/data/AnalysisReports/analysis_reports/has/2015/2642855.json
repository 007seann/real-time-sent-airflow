However, toy maker Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) seems to have hit upon the right formula to tap the growth of this market. In fact, Hasbro has turned in a market-beating performance this year as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/business/hasbro-outperforms-mattel-as-barbies-struggles-continue.html?partner=yahoofinance&amp;_r=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">robust sales</a> of Marvel and Transformers intellectual properties have driven its results. In fact, the company has outperformed arch-rival Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) quite handsomely this year, and going forward, it is quite likely that Hasbro will continue getting better as it is using popular films to its advantage.</p> <p><b>Using popular franchises to power growth</b></p> <p>Hasbro benefits from two famous tailwinds -- Marvel and Transformers. These two have allowed it to outperform its competitors at a good pace on the back of regular movie releases and new merchandise. In fact, the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-profit-43-pct-higher-114555779.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">box-office success</a> of characters such as Spider-Man, Iron-Man, and Transformers drove Hasbro's profit 43% higher on a year-over-year basis last quarter.</p> <p>More importantly, close to 30 superhero movies are <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2014/10/28/upcoming-superhero-movies-marvel-dc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to be released in the next six years. As such, Hasbro will see consistent opportunities to capitalize on new releases to sustain its sales growth. Clearly, Hasbro is employing s smart strategy by relying on famous movie franchises to push up sales, while rivals like Mattel are struggling.</p> <p>In fact, Mattel struggled to increase its sales last quarter as it saw a 21% decline in Barbie sales, along with weak demand for American Girl and other major categories. On the other hand, Hasbro made a smart move by <a href=\"https://news.investors.com/102014-722535-hasbro-leverages-movies-to-increase-toy-sales-in-q3.htm?ven=yahoocp&amp;src=aurlled&amp;ven=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">entering</a> into a deal with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) to make dolls based on animated movies such as Frozen and other Disney stories. In fact, Hasbro <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/09/25/disney-princess-dolls-to-reign-at-hasbro-from-mattel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">replaced</a> Mattel with this deal. This will add further pressure on Mattel's Barbie sales as<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Frozen is one of the top-grossing movies in Hollywood with a </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27585310\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">collection</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> of almost $1.3 billion, and Hasbro can now use it to its advantage.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The market for dolls was <a href=\"https://www.toyassociation.org/tia/industry_facts/salesdata/industryfacts/sales_data/sales_data.aspx?hkey=6381a73a-ce46-4caf-8bc1-72b99567df1e#.VFhvZvmUfT8\" rel=\"nofollow\">worth</a> $2.7 billion at the end of last year. Hence, this is a lucrative market where Hasbro is trying to move ahead of its rival Mattel, and its tie-up with Disney will most probably help it capture more share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2576075-hasbros-has-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\">According</a> to Brian Goldner, Hasbro's president and CEO, \"Hasbro will develop small and fashion dolls based on Disney Princess stories and characters as well as Frozen. Hasbro's line will be at retailers beginning in 2016.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>New launches to tide over headwinds</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, Hasbro is seeing headwinds in certain segments such as the pre-school division, where sales declined 7% on a year-over-year basis last quarter. One of the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2014/10/20/hasbro-transformers-sales/?xid=yahoo_fortune\" rel=\"nofollow\">main reasons</a> behind this decline was lower birth rates in the U.S. as millennials are avoiding starting a family.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But, Hasbro expects its situation to improve in the future, and as such, it is now focusing on new product introductions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2576075-hasbros-has-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\">launching</a> a number of new games such as \"Magic 2015,\" \"Khans of Tarkir,\" and others, which will place it in a better position. Also, the company is focusing on the development of the next installment of Transformers content. According to management, \"We are investing in the brand both in digital and analog play through technology and storytelling.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro plans to launch the next installment of Transformers television programming, Transformers: Robots In Disguise, going forward. This will air on Cartoon Network in the U.S., which is the top-rated network for Boys aged 6 to 11 and 9 to 14. Now, the company's focus on television content will help it stay relevant in the minds of its target audience who watch cartoons and other related content. As a result, Hasbro will be able to sustain the sales of its Transformers franchise, along with other product line-ups.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, the company is also developing animated movies such as \"My Little Pony\" and \"Jem And The Holograms.\" These will be produced under its new label, <a href=\"https://tformers.com/hasbro-announce-allspark-pictures-division-to-produce-transformers-and-other-brands-during-earnings-call/24991/news.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Allspark Pictures</a>. Management anticipates Allspark Pictures to make a significant contribution to animated movies based on new and existing Hasbro brands for audiences globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro currently trades close to its 52-week high, which is not surprising considering the company's strong growth. But, the good part is that the stock is expected to scale greater heights going forward, as analysts <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=HAS+Analyst+Estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\">anticipate</a> its earnings to grow at an annual rate of 12.4%, way better than the drop of 3.44% that it has seen in the last five years.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has various new products and properties in the pipeline that will strengthen its position in the future. In addition, it trades at a cheap trailing P/E multiple of 20 and a lower forward P/E multiple of 16, making it a good investment for the long run.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - How Hasbro Is Leveraging Movies And Television To Its Advantage. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2642855-how-hasbro-is-leveraging-movies-and-television-to-its-advantage?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "54222", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "144351", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "110692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "460745", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2642855-how-hasbro-is-leveraging-movies-and-television-to-its-advantage", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2642855-how-hasbro-is-leveraging-movies-and-television-to-its-advantage", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "54222", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "renu-singh", "userId": 13817032, "tagId": 110692, "bio": "Renu Singh's focus is on finding both value and growth.
