The company saw growth return to all business segments and most regions. This comes during a relatively quiet quarter. With continuing strength in segments, huge franchises signed to licensing deals, and growth in the company's entertainment segment, this appears to be only the beginning for this ever changing toy company.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2576075-hasbros-has-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\">third quarter</a>, total revenue grew 7%. Operating profit increased 9%, and came with a margin of 19.4%. Franchise brand revenue was particularly strong with growth of 36%. In fact, all seven franchise brands grew by double digits in the quarter. Sales in the United States and Canada segment were up 4%, while operating profit increased 16% in that region. Total international sales were up 11%, with growth of 7% in Europe, 24% in Latin America, and 11% in Asia Pacific. Sales for the entertainment/license business segment increased 10%.</p> <p>Total sales for the third quarter were:</p> <p>\u00b7 United States &amp; Canada: $764.3 million</p> <p>\u00b7 International: $649.3 million</p> <p>\u00b7 Entertainment/Licensing: $53.4 million</p> <p>Sales by item for the quarter:</p> <p>\u00b7 Boys: $475.5 million, +22%</p> <p>\u00b7 Games: $395.2 million, +2%</p> <p>\u00b7 Girls: $407.7 million, +5%</p> <p>\u00b7 Preschool: $188.5 million, -7%</p> <p>The seven franchise brands are:</p> <p>\u00b7 Transformers</p> <p>\u00b7 Monopoly</p> <p>\u00b7 Play-Doh</p> <p>\u00b7 My Little Pony</p> <p>\u00b7 Magic the Gathering</p> <p>\u00b7 Nerf</p> <p>\u00b7 Littlest Pet Shop</p> <p>One item to highlight of the franchise brands is My Little Pony. The brand continues to expand through licensing and entertainment. Earlier this month, My Little Pony signed a deal with PEZ. The brand had done $650 million in retail at the time of the deal. \"My Little Pony: Friendship Magic\" was recently <a href=\"https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-renewed-for-fifth-season-by-the-hub/261197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">renewed</a> for a fifth season on the former Hub Network, to premiere<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in 2015. Made for television movies of the brand have also </span><a href=\"https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/04/hub-network-original-movie-my-little-pony-equestria-girls-delivers-triple-digit-growth-year-to-year/200918/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">helped</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> boost ratings for the Hub Network.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Part of the conference call discussed the recently announced licensing deal with Hasbro for the Frozen line of dolls. I wrote an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2528805-disneys-frozen-deal-with-hasbro-strengthens-franchise-sets-up-likely-sequel\">article</a> about this from the Disney side of things, hinting that the deal sets up for a yet unannounced sequel to the popular $1 billion movie. In the quarter's conference call, Hasbro said the deal provides a \"complement to the prolific boys' entertainment slate.\" My article predicted a sequel movie coming November 21, 2018, based on reserved dates by Disney.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro said the guaranteed minimum royalties to Disney for Frozen would be less and that 2015 will include some costs related to producing the new lines. This is good and bad news for investors as profits may take a slight dip, but if the Frozen branded merchandise is strong, it could power Hasbro into the future. Hasbro is paying guaranteed minimum royalties of $80 million and $225 million to Disney for Marvel and Star Wars respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another item in heavy discussion during the third quarter call was the shift of the Hub Network to Discovery Family. This transition was completed on October 13th and as a result Discovery Communications (DISCA) now owns 60% of the joint venture, while Hasbro owns the remaining 40%. With the transition Hasbro will still have hours of block time during the day, but Discovery will focus on putting new family oriented content on at night. The Hub Network joint venture had a profit of $1.9 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $91,000 in the prior year. Hasbro got $64.4 million from the sale of the 10% to Discovery Communications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Along with the shift of The Hub Network, Hasbro is focusing on bringing its popular Transformers brand back to the Cartoon Network. A new show called \"Transformers: Robots in Disguise\" will air on Cartoon Network beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Hasbro believes this is a better fit for the show, with better demographics of key viewership amongst boys versus the former Hub Network. The company also briefly touched on adding a Play-Doh television show in China, but didn't offer details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In entertainment, Hasbro has also launched a new film label called Allspark Pictures. The label will help bring \"Jem and the Holograms\" to the big screen October 23, 2015. It will also bring the newly announced \"My Little Pony Movie\" to big screens in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When you think of board games being made into big screen movies, many probably think of \"Jumanji\" or \"Battleship\". Hasbro is at it again with a movie based on its \"Ouija\" game. The movie will be released October 24th with Universal Pictures. Before you write off \"Ouija\" as a box office disaster, consider that it could see large turnouts from teenagers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Universal Pictures <a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/news/snapchat-scares-up-advertising-business-with-ouija-1201334130/\" rel=\"nofollow\">made</a> \"Ouija\" the first advertisement ever shown on Snapchat. The twenty second ad was sent as an update on Snapchat and possibly seen by more than 100 million users of the popular disappearing messaging service. \"Ouija\" was also part of a couple promotions and fake events with Full Screen Media. Those items helped generate 5.6 million video views, 17.3 million hashtag impressions, and 510,000 social engagements. The heavy targeted advertisements to teenagers and tweens may pay off and make this a potential franchise brand in the highly profitable horror genre.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Shares of Hasbro hit highs of $57.16 on Monday before closing the day up 5% at $56.51. On Tuesday, shares are up another 1% and continue to see high volume as investors dig into the earnings report. I still believe shares are cheap when factoring in the growth coming over the next six years. Keep in mind that the Frozen deal begins in 2016, and Star Wars and Marvel are signed through 2020.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even with Tuesday's continued movement, shares are up only 5% in 2014. The company's dividend yield is still 4.5%, offering a nice return for shareholders as they join along for the ride from big blockbuster movies coming Hasbro's way. Shares are up 54% since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/919881-8-reasons-to-add-hasbro-to-your-portfolio-before-christmas\">recommendation</a> in 2012. I see plenty more growth ahead for patient shareholders.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Strong Earnings Foreshadow Exciting Future. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2583365-hasbros-strong-earnings-foreshadow-exciting-future?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "21820", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "143531", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "5332", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "11275", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2583365-hasbros-strong-earnings-foreshadow-exciting-future", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2583365-hasbros-strong-earnings-foreshadow-exciting-future", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "21820", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "chris-katje", "userId": 188998, "tagId": 11275, "bio": "<p>Chris Katje is an investor from Grand Rapids, Michigan.
