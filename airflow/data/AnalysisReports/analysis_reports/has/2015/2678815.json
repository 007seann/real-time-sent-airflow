Net revenue leapt 7% in the period, with sales growing in all major operating segments. Emerging markets revenue jumped nearly 30%, while franchise brand sales increased at a faster pace. Importantly, all seven of Hasbro's franchise brands showed revenue increases during the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit and earnings advanced 9%, though reported results were much more impressive. Compared to <a href=\"https://www.valuentum.com/articles/20141016_4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mattel's ongoing malaise</a>, Hasbro is shining bright.</p> <p>Hasbro is not so much a toy company as it is a branding and licensing firm. Management echoed our views in the release about the ongoing momentum it is building in its franchise brands and with key partners including Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>), and we could not be more impressed. The new strategic merchandizing relationship with Disney Consumer Products for the Disney Princess and Frozen properties is a huge win for Hasbro, and we expect the company to benefit from the relationship for years to come. Elsa and Anna, the two princesses in the blockbuster animated film <em>Frozen</em>, may take share from Mattel's legacy Barbie franchise, something that we are already witnessing. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie were down 21% in <a href=\"https://news.mattel.com/News/Mattel-Reports-Third-Quarter-2014-Financial-Results-and-Declares-Fourth-Quarter-Dividend-41c.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mattel's most recent quarter</a>. Given the worldwide acclaim of <em>Frozen</em>, Barbie's reign as the must-have doll could be over. Barbie could now be to girls as baseball cards (CLCT) are to boys - merely a collector's item that will eventually fade in popularity (and by extension, value).</p> <p>Followers of Valuentum's <a href=\"https://www.valuentum.com/articles/20120809_4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dividend Growth portfolio</a> have known for a while how much we like shares of Hasbro, and we continue to like them. Our fair value estimate of the firm is $62 per share, and the company<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> yields 3.2%. The company's dividend growth prospects are fantastic, boasting a Dividend Cushion ratio of 1.9 (the greater the ratio above 1, the better). Hasbro's weighting in the Dividend Growth portfolio is ~8%. We showcase Hasbro's dividend report below.
