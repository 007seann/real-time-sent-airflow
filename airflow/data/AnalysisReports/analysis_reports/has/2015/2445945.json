We could only add one due to diversification considerations (both are consumer discretionary physical toy makers), and both had strong dividends and were undervalued. Hasbro, however, had a slightly better <a href=\"https://www.valuentum.com/search2?searchtext=has&amp;searchtype=symbol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dividend Cushion</a> score, and we opted to include its shares in the portfolio instead of Mattel's.</p> <p>Though we discussed a great many different things about both of the companies, we've been very pleased with the selection of Hasbro into the portfolio, and we credit the Dividend Cushion methodology for providing the incremental <em>relative</em> insight into the stock-selection process. Since its addition, Hasbro has leapt more than 60%, excluding dividend payments, while Mattel has increased by less than half of that mark. We know many of you own Hasbro, and while the firm has given up some ground recently, we trust you are happy with the company's outperformance.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/22/saupload_HAS_MAT_comparison.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/22/saupload_HAS_MAT_comparison_thumb1.jpg\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>One of the fundamental reasons why we like Hasbro rests in its strong brand portfolio. Franchise brand revenue grew 15% on a year-over-year basis in 2013 and represented ~44% of its total revenue, up from 38% in 2008. From \"Magic the Gathering\" and \"Nerf\" to \"Play-Doh,\" \"Transformers\" and \"Monopoly,\" Hasbro's brand equity is as strong as it comes.</p> <p>Revenue may face intermittent pressure as physical toys continue to be slowly replaced with digital experiences, but Hasbro's brands will continue to represent the source of excitement across any platform. Growth in emerging markets and in a variety of entertainment platforms will continue to propel expansion at the toy giant. For example, Hasbro's 2015 movie slate includes \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron\", \"B.O.O. Bureau of the Otherworldly Operations\", \"Jurassic World\", \"Ant Man\", and \"Star Wars VII\" (December 18, 2014) -- a solid line-up.</p> <p>During</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro's Dividend Growth Prospects Remain Intact. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2445945-hasbros-dividend-growth-prospects-remain-intact?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24491", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1748", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "34650", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2445945-hasbros-dividend-growth-prospects-remain-intact", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2445945-hasbros-dividend-growth-prospects-remain-intact", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/22/saupload_HAS_MAT_comparison.jpg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/22/saupload_HAS_MAT_comparison.jpg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "24491", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "valuentum", "userId": 933684, "tagId": 34650, "bio": "<p>We offer subscriptions and exclusive newsletters.
