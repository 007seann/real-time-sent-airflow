DreamWorks shares were the beneficiary of the boost during the week, as those holding Hasbro were worried about potential effects of these talks harming the company's partnership with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>). Right now, Hasbro has a nice partnership with Disney where both companies can take advantage of the recent influx of comic book based movies that have been setting box office records. The following chart shows how Hasbro, DreamWorks, and Disney all responded to the rumours of the merger talks to end last week.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/11/15/saupload_bde8656273f40ebf3867a14cb885161e.png\" alt=\"HAS Price Chart\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"yc_font\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/intraday_price\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">HAS Price</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" dofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></p> <p>You can see that Disney continued to trade as usual, while DreamWorks jumped 17% and Hasbro sold off about 7%.</p> <p>It was reported from several sources that DreamWorks was looking for an offer of more than $30 per share, which would put the value of DreamWorks at $2.56 billion. Hasbro has been the beneficiary of all of the Marvel comics that have been made into blockbuster movies, and has seen decent demand for its action figures. It licenses characters like Spider-Man from Disney.</p> <p>At the office, we concluded on Friday morning that such a merger was unlikely, but we had much simpler reasons. Hasbro is a toy company and DreamWorks is an animation company. We just didn't think the list of synergies would be robust enough for a deal between these tow companies merging. One of our analysts, Thom, said it would be akin to \"Ford merging with Under Armour. It doesn't make sense.\"</p> <p>Business Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/merger-talks-between-hasbro-and-dreamworks-are-over-2014-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> over the weekend:</p> <blockquote class=\"quote\"> <p>But <a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/dreamworks-animation-sale-talks-with-hasbro-end-1201356896/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to Variety</a>, citing sources, those talks are now over. The sources say that the reason the talks ended was because of the unfavorable reception<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Wall Street gave the news on Wednesday.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analysts were wary of the possibility, saying that the move <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hasbro-and-dreamworks-animation-merger-makes-no-sense-2014-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">made little sense</a> for Hasbro, among other concerns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"We don't see a plausible argument for why HAS would pay 41% of its current market capitalization for a company which, according to its CEO is facing serious challenges,\" media analyst Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee wrote. \"Films profitability continues to decline and the ramp in consumer product revenue the bulls hoped for isn't coming: the revenue stream is down 21% so far in 2014.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Neither of the companies officially confirmed to Variety that the talks ended.</p> </blockquote> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Obviously, this doesn't come as a surprise to us. Investors that were banking on a merger between these two companies will likely be quick to sell off DreamWorks first thing on Monday. Buying on speculation is never a good idea, we believe. In this case, it's clearly obvious, due to these reports combined with common sense surrounding the idea, that a merger between Hasbro and DreamWorks is likely off the table for the long term.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS $DWA-DEFUNCT-104 - The Hasbro/DreamWorks Merger Ain't Happening. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2685715-the-hasbro-dreamworks-merger-aint-happening?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "70965", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "104", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "165595", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2685715-the-hasbro-dreamworks-merger-aint-happening", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2685715-the-hasbro-dreamworks-merger-aint-happening", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/11/15/saupload_bde8656273f40ebf3867a14cb885161e.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/11/15/saupload_bde8656273f40ebf3867a14cb885161e.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "70965", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "orange-peel-investments", "userId": 30605895, "tagId": 165595, "bio": "Contributors: Scott Tzu, Parke Shall, Thom Lachenmann\r\n(contributors write under pen names for anonymity purposes)\r\n\r\nPlease read Seeking Alpha's Policy on Anonymous Contributors to familiarize yourself with the site's terms and conditions relating to anonymous authors.\r\n", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/030/605/895/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/030/605/895/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/030/605/895/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/030/605/895/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Orange Peel Investments", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2014, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 7684}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "30605895", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "752706", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/orange-peel-investments", "profileUrl": "/author/orange-peel-investments", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "104", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dwa-defunct-104", "name": "DWA", "company": "Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": true, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/DWA-DEFUNCT-104"}}, {"id": "165595", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "orange-peel-investments", "name": "Orange Peel Investments", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/orange-peel-investments"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}]}
