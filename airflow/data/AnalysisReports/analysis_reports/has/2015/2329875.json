Despite the reported revenue growth, after posting years of stagnant sales, revenues still fell short compared to consensus estimates.</p> <p>Despite years of stagnation, Hasbro has created a lot of value for investors in recent years. Serial share repurchases, appealing dividends and the strong brand franchise has pushed up the valuation, creating nice returns for investors.</p> <p>For the future, I am less optimistic unless Hasbro can show continued revenue grow and stabilize or increase its margins.

As such, diluted earnings were down by two cents to $0.26 per share.</p> <p>Adjusted earnings, which are a non-GAAP earnings metric, came in at $0.36 per share and was in line with consensus estimates.</p> <p><strong>Looking Into The Quarter</strong></p> <p>CEO Brian Goldner is stressing that the results demonstrate the efforts and focus on strategic growth opportunities. This is as sales growth is driven by the strategic international business as well as entertainment and licensing business.</p> <p>Entertainment and licensing is the fastest growing, but also the smallest, part of the business. It posted a 35% increase in revenues towards $47.7 million as fat operating profits quadrupled to $14.6 million. Growth was driven by growth in digital gaming, lifestyle licensing as well as the acquisition of Backflip studios.</p> <p>The international business also performed well, posting a 17% jump in sales towards $396.8 million. Double-digit growth was seen in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
