As an owner of Hasbro, that's pretty good for a day's work (translation: doing nothing). They also <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=824366\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced an increase in the quarterly dividend payment</a> to $.43 representing a 7.5% increase to their previous rate of $.40. Again, +7.5% to your income stream is great for a day's work, right?</p> <p>For many people that answer is definitely a yes. For me, I'm cautiously skeptical. I purchased Hasbro stock on two occasions in 2012. In both cases, the purchases were for my dividend growth centered Roth IRA. Hasbro is up 60% over my cost basis. On a percentage basis, it's actually my best performing position. That represents very nice capital return but I was really banking on the 4%+ dividend yield at the time of purchase. Now I'm concerned that the price appreciation could negatively affect my DRIP purchases.</p> <p>How is an investor to cope? By writing a Seeking Alpha article! I want to know two things: 1) Why did the share price increase so much? and 2) What does this mean for DRIP purchases? To answer these questions, I'll be using information from Hasbro's annual reports available at their <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/annuals.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">annual reports webpage</a>. Their 2013 annual report has not yet been filed but their recently released quarterly report for the end of 2013 is available on Harbro's <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/results.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">quarterly reports webpage</a>.</p> <p><strong>Investigating the Share Price Increase</strong></p> <p>First, we must consider if the price run up is inline with the general market performance. Since I purchased Hasbro both in the first and last half of 2012, I selected a nice midpoint towards the end of June 2012 as my start date. The end date is February 10, 2014.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/739532-13920808168884373-Seeking-Anything.png\" alt=\"HAS vs SPY since July 2012\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>According to Google Finance the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) gained 32.10% in</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Flies High, But What Does This Mean For Dividend Growth Investors?. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2011661-hasbro-flies-high-but-what-does-this-mean-for-dividend-growth-investors?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "47601", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "86", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "101241", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2011661-hasbro-flies-high-but-what-does-this-mean-for-dividend-growth-investors", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2011661-hasbro-flies-high-but-what-does-this-mean-for-dividend-growth-investors", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/739532-13920808168884373-Seeking-Anything.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/2/10/739532-13920808168884373-Seeking-Anything.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "47601", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "seeking-anything", "userId": 739532, "tagId": 101241, "bio": "Future early retiree thanks to dividend growth investing.
