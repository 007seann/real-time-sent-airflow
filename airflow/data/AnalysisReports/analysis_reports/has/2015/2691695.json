My investment thesis for this company is based on a few primary points. The prospects of the toy-buying season are strong, which will allow the company to capitalize on the holiday spending spree. The revenue and earnings growth is substantial. The dividend track record has been solid with increases taking place over the last several years. Hasbro's goal of providing increased shareholder value through stock buybacks is another factor.</p> <p>Last week, news came out that Hasbro was in merger talks, causing the price of Hasbro stock to drop in price by over 4% last Thursday. However, that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2130095-hasbro-dreamworks-deal-fizzles\">deal has fizzled</a>. This will allow the company to concentrate on its business and investors to concentrate on the stock's core fundamentals.</p> <p>Looking at the prospects for the toy buying season, the historical financials for the company, and the potential for future growth, this stock should be in your stocking, or at least in your portfolio.</p> <p><b>The Holiday Buying Season</b></p> <p>November and December are important months for retailers, with significantly more sales taking place during the holiday season. If sales this season are strong, the retailers will benefit, and the toy retailers will especially benefit, which should help drive share prices higher for the toy stocks.</p> <p>So let's look at what is expected for the next few weeks. According to a report by the <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/optimism-shines-national-retail-federation-forecasts-holiday-sales-increase-41\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Retail Federation</a> last month, retail sales should increase by 4.1% to $616.9 billion for the months of November and December, beating the 3.1% increase for 2013, and significantly beating the average increase of 2.9% over the past 10 years.</p> <p>With anticipated growth like this and with Hasbro positioned in the perfect industry of</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Will Benefit From The Holiday Shopping Season. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2691695-hasbro-will-benefit-from-the-holiday-shopping-season?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "20413", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "5341", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2691695-hasbro-will-benefit-from-the-holiday-shopping-season", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2691695-hasbro-will-benefit-from-the-holiday-shopping-season", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "20413", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "stockerblog", "userId": 34670, "tagId": 5341, "bio": "<p>The author of Stockerblog worked for over 20 years in the financial services industry as a stockbroker, investment advisor, Vice President of a San Francisco money management firm, mutual fund wholesaler, and market maker on the Pacific Stock Exchange.
