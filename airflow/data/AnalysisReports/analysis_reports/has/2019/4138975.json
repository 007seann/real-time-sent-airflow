However, I suspect that lull belies the rollercoaster year ahead as the market looks for clues as to whether the two leading toy firms can navigate successfully the challenges brought about by the Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy and the rise in digital screen time. A review of the earnings surprise record showed that analysts had difficulty providing accurate estimates for both companies. After Mattel missed the EBITDA consensus estimate by more than 350%, analysts continued to be overly bullish and Mattel never failed to disappoint, with the latest miss at 31% off the consensus estimate. Hasbro's negative surprises have been much more benign, at no more than 6%. Its positive surprises, on the other hand, had reached 26% in the past two years. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/saupload_b5ef9c3d751b1e4328f65dfac45513bd.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/quarterly_ebitda_surprise\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS Quarterly EBITDA Surprise</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure><p>Besides the quarterly-led volatility, the share prices might also react to favorable announcements of moves by the two companies in tackling the digital shift promised last year. Negative news could come in the form of weaker-than-expected movie takings which would portend poorer sales of movie-linked merchandise. Both the toy titans seem poised to prove themselves this year, after a disappointing 2017. Nevertheless, I believe the reliability of the Hasbro<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> management and the company's much stronger fundamentals meant that Hasbro is the safer bet among the two to ride a comeback in the toy sector. I elaborate my rationale below. </span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Review Of The Financial Numbers</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro's revenue finally surpassed that of Mattel in the third-quarter of 2017. However, numerous other financial numbers and indicators have already reflected the crossover earlier. For instance, in my article on the two names published last February discussing the merger speculation then, I included a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4044771-hasbro-mattel-merger-speculation-will-barbie-say-yes-g-joe#comment-74335979\">chart showing the Return of Invested Capital</a> (\"ROIC\"), a key metric demonstrating management's effectiveness, which clearly indicated the sharp reversal in performance as early as 2014. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/saupload_bc9b4596f7ac2c5f4c2af5d4f9d24412.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/revenues_ttm\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS Revenue</a> (TTM) data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For a more in-depth understanding of company fundamentals, looking beyond the income statement is a must. The cash flow statements revealed a weaker Mattel since 2015. On a preceding five-year period basis, Mattel's free cash flow (\"FCF\") deteriorated 116% while Hasbro's FCF rose by 44.5% in the same period. This was partly the result of having to spend as much as the latter on CapEx. Consequently, the net financial debt at Mattel ballooned to more than six times the level five years ago, while at Hasbro, it merely grew by 30%. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/saupload_fdecb3e2429a3b1e923280b13a78ff62.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/free_cash_flow_ttm\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS Free Cash Flow</a> (TTM) data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure><h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Research Models Suggest The Fundamentals of Hasbro Surpassed Mattel in 2014 and The Divergence Has Become More Glaring</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Academics have over the years performed extensive research to develop models that can predict the future of companies. There are several models that focus on foretelling the probability of failures or bankruptcies. The formula in the models was developed with extensive backtesting. In this investigation, I used Fulmer H Factor, Springate Score, and Sustainable Growth. While the models were generally meant for predicting the probability of bankruptcy, the metrics employed in the model calculations (e.g. Average Total Debt/Total Equity, Average Working Capital/Average Total Debt) are essentially used in the fundamental analysis in some form or another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">YCharts' <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/fulmer_h_score\" rel=\"nofollow\">glossary stated </a>that the Fulmer H Factor model \"can certainly be used as a guide to differentiate which stocks may be safer, and which may be less safe.\" Hence, although recognizing the limitations, the model is a neat method to compare the metrics of two or more companies. In the case of Hasbro and Mattel, the model was the first among the three models to indicate the divergence between the two toy companies. Since reflecting the relative \"safety\" of Hasbro over Mattel in mid-2014, the model has churned out a pattern that corresponded with the share price movements of the two toy companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A simpler model, the <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/springate_score\" rel=\"nofollow\">Springate Score</a>, employs the use of only four out of nineteen common financial ratios to determine the likelihood of firms failing. It similarly reflected the divergence, albeit slightly delayed from the Fulmer H Factor model. If an even more direct approach is preferred, the <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/sustainable_growth_rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sustainable Growth Rate</a> comes to mind. It is derived by the multiplication of the Return on Equity with the Retention Ratio (the opposite of the payout ratio). Again, the divergence is reflected in the Sustainable Growth Rate chart. In addition, the output suggests that Hasbro could grow as much as 18% before it needs to borrow more money to fund its growth. On the other hand, Mattel would have to deleverage significantly at its current growth rate. This is something which seems obvious in hindsight but the model has already flagged the need to de-lever as early as 2015. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/saupload_4a0e1094dff7be339546320794e539ab.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"534\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure><h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualitative Discussion On The Toy Industry</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In my article titled \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4105059-hasbro-mattel-implications-woes-facing-lego-toys-r-us#comments_header\">Implications Of Woes Facing Lego And Toys 'R' Us</a>\", I struck a positive note which was rather against the grain. Observers have raised concern over the store closures at Toys 'R' Us. A negative impact on the toy makers is inevitable, given the reduced number of stores. However, the skepticism over the ability of Target (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\">TGT</a>) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\">WMT</a>) to cover the slack seems to be overblown. Stores at Toys 'R' Us have perfected the trick of eliciting impulse purchases and the enormous offerings meant that such purchases are likely to be magnified. It is feared that given the smaller selection of toys at Target and Wal-Mart, impulse buying of toys would surely be diminished.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am of the opposing camp, as I believe unplanned purchases of toys could actually increase given the greater frequency of grocery shopping. Furthermore, Target and Walmart have proven themselves to be fantastic at inventory turnover. They should be able to achieve higher turnover for toys as well. The proliferation of YouTube videos of children opening, setting up, and playing with toys churns out a whole new generation of kids who pester their parents to buy the toys they saw on YouTube. The parents are likely to do so online or they might also make a dedicated trip to Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us to check them out in person. In the latter case, the parents might even pick up other toys thanks, of course, to impulse buying. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro and Mattel have separately announced their digital initiatives. They have also sought to collaborate with technology companies to accelerate their efforts. Hasbro has some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4138505-game-changer-tencent-tie-lego#comment-77411458\">licensing agreement</a> with Tencent for its Transformers franchise. Cognizant of the experiential tendencies of the Millenials, Hasbro has also teamed up with Cityneon, a Singapore-listed company, to launch interactive exhibitions around the world. Mattel has a partnership with Alibaba for its Fisher-Price branded interactive learning products. They are not alone. Lego has recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4138505-game-changer-tencent-tie-lego#comments_header\">announced a comprehensive tie-up</a> with Chinese social media and gaming titan Tencent (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCTZF\">OTCPK:TCTZF</a>). 2018 could see the fruition of their innovations as well as broader and deeper collaboration with their respective partners. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/44555366-15165615913378224_origin.jfif\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"1131\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/44555366-15165615913378224.jfif\" alt=\"Transformers Autobot Alliance Interactive Exhbition Poster\" width=\"640\" height=\"905\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"905\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>(Source: Hasbro/Cityneon)</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I think both of the two leading toy companies have a good chance of adapting to the new paradigm. Mattel has the added catalyst of being a candidate for takeover which would almost certainly be done at a comfortable premium to the current price. Some Seeking Alpha community members have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4125870-hasbro-mattel-merger-key-stumbling-blocks#comment-76841939\">touted prices above $20/share</a>. Mattel could also bank on investors with a contrarian bend. Such investors might be emboldened by successful turnaround cases last year in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4115376-crocs-selling-opportunity#comment-76577807\">fellow retail name Crocs</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CROX\" title=\"Crocs, Inc.\">CROX</a>), <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4119574-l-brands-taking-profit#comment-76679763\">niche retail player L Brands</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LB\" title=\"LandBridge Company LLC\">LB</a>), and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4106033-unilever-sell-now#comment-76351455\">consumer products giant Unilever</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UN\">UN</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL\" title=\"Unilever PLC\">UL</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nevertheless, my bet is on Hasbro being the fundamentally sound vehicle to ride the upheaval. Hasbro trades at a low EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.8x, compared to Mattel's 18.9x. Even on a forward basis, Mattel's 14.95x is still a few notches above Hasbro's 11.03x. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/21/saupload_9ee7b23613314448ab28a076623e3f73.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/ev_ebitda\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS EV to EBITDA</a> (TTM) data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analysts seem to agree, with the price upside for Hasbro significantly higher than that for Mattel.
