That\u2019s what happened when Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-08/toys-r-us-said-to-be-prepping-liquidation-of-u-s-operations\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that it may have to cease operations as nobody appears to be coming to the rescue. Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>), Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), and JAKKS Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" title=\"JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\">JAKK</a>) may feel some near-term operational discomfort, but we\u2019re not overreacting.</p> <p>If a rescue deal doesn\u2019t happen for Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, online verticals and big box retailers such as Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>) may easily fill the void. Target CEO Brian Cornell noted, in particular, that his company is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-toys-investors/toys-are-not-us-target-investors-idUSKCN1G61KY\" rel=\"nofollow\">playing</a> to win in toys.\u201d Though we\u2019re viewing the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us announcement as more \u2018headline noise\u2019 than anything that may impact the toy makers over the long haul, readers may expect forward near-term guidance to now have a more cautious bent, and that may disappoint some investors.</p> <p>Rumors of a deal between Hasbro and Mattel haven\u2019t let up from <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/hasbro-ceo-deflects-question-on-mattel-talks-touts-dividend-raise.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">what we can tell</a>, and we think the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us possible liquidation could grease the wheels for further talks, as anti-trust interference may not be that fierce given end market troubles and concentrated online distributor power through the likes of Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and eBay (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBAY\" title=\"eBay Inc.\">EBAY</a>). We continue to like Hasbro the most out of the toy makers, <em>but we caution management against the temptation to overpay for Mattel\u2019s assets</em>, as the Barbie franchise could very well be in terminal decline, given Disney\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) <em>Frozen</em> success. We also like that Hasbro continues to pull a variety of levers, the latest <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005319/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an agreement</a> with Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) to create toys and games from the <em>Super Monsters </em>animated kids series. This follows the Hasbro-Netflix\u2019s joint effort to bring a collection of games to <em>Stranger Things</em> fans.</p> <p>We wrote about Hasbro\u2019s<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> fourth-quarter report, released February 7, and at the time, we highlighted that management had pointed \u201cto slower consumer demand for both the company and its industry in November and December,\u201d but we also said that we think management is confident that its innovative lines and digital initiatives will deliver in 2018.</span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> What we\u2019re watching closely at Hasbro is the long-term trajectory of its \u2018Entertainment and Licensing\u2019 business line,</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> where on a full-year basis, operating profit in the segment nearly doubled, to $96.4 million on just ~8% revenue expansion (the division posted a near-34% operating margin). This segment may hold the keys to Hasbro\u2019s future, but even so, Hasbro was able to still drive revenues nearly $1 billion higher during the past 5 years. Physical toy sales are under pressure, but by no means, dead.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s equity has advanced considerably during the past 5 years, and its 10%+ dividend increase, to a quarterly payout of $0.63, on February 7, means shares now have a forward yield of 2.8%. We\u2019re not overreacting to the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us announcement by any stretch, with our discounted cash-flow-derived fair value estimate of Hasbro hovering in the high-$80s at the time of this writing.
