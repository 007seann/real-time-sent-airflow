As for Mattel, its operating results continue to worsen so it is hard to see a rebound based on fundamentals. Nevertheless, the negatives appear to be priced-in and the catalyst from a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4125870-hasbro-mattel-merger-key-stumbling-blocks#comments_header\">potential takeover</a> cannot be totally dismissed. Mattel can only be considered a speculative buy at this point. </em></p></blockquote> <p>Barely three months have passed, and boy, am I amazed by the returns Mattel achieved, rising as much as 36 percent. To think that I only considered Mattel as \"a speculative buy,\" while favoring Hasbro from a fundamental perspective. The prevailing sentiment then was for Mattel to merge with (or be acquired by) Hasbro as a catalyst for a price appreciation. That didn't happen, at least not yet, but Mattel climbed anyway. Hasbro only returned 24 percent at its highest point and is now still trailing behind Mattel with 17 percent versus the latter's 20 percent.</p> <p><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/8/2/saupload_eb580b30f51bd054a7c4da68187abbdd.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></figure></p> <p><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\">MAT data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <h3>Q2 2018 Results Was A Strong Beat</h3> <p>Recently, Hasbro reported its second-quarter 2018 results, which surpassed consensus estimates. It achieved a revenue of $904.46 million, which was lower by 7.0% year on year but was higher than Street expectations by $66.37 million. Q2 EPS of $0.48 also handily beat expectations by $0.18, sending the stock soaring on the first trading day following the results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro was foremostly negatively impacted by the liquidation of Toys \"R\" Us in the U.S. and many other global markets. In Europe, the company said that it had to grapple with \"a rapid growth in online purchases and the changing dynamics of brick-and-mortar retailing,\" in addition to the malaise from the closing of Toys \"R\" Us stores. U.S. and Canada revenue fell 7 percent to $459.3 million. International revenue fell 11 percent to $380.4 million, mainly due to the 16 percent decline in Europe, while Latin America and Asia Pacific dropped 3 percent and 5 percent respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This set of declines isn't that bad when you recall that in the first quarter, U.S. and Canada revenue plunged 19 percent and International revenue fell by 17 percent, with Europe crashing 28 percent. Nevertheless, the sustained revenue declines have strained the company's cash position. Its net financial debt is higher year on year on a trailing twelve-month basis, with free cash flow on a downtrend since Q1 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/8/2/saupload_f4d4e9ae1065c988a5d8cf8149a5131a.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HAS/dividend_yield\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAS Dividend Yield</a> (TTM) data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Steady Dividend Increases</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The bright spot for investors is that Hasbro continues to delight shareholders with its steady dividend growth, which has increased by 12 percent CAGR in the current 10-year period. During this period, Hasbro has given out $1.9 billion in dividends in total, a handsome sum considering that its market capitalization is presently at $12.65 billion. The company has raised its dividend 14 times in the last 15 years, with the latest quarterly hike at 11 percent.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Consensus Price Target Appears Conservative</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Following the positive earnings surprise, analysts have rushed to raise their target prices, which had earlier suffered some downgrades no thanks to the Toys \"R\" Us fallout. Nevertheless, the consensus price target is now just around $106, offering limited upside from the prevailing trading price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/8/2/saupload_f094b3647cdb229b75f955c98619a5a2.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\">HAS data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, I believe Hasbro still has further room for appreciation considering that some analysts appeared to be overly bearish. For instance, just a few days before the company released its Q2 2018 results, analyst Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital downgraded the stock to Underperform from Market Perform citing valuation concerns, and <a href=\"https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+PT+Change/BMO+Capital+Downgrades+Hasbro+%28HAS%29+to+Underperform/14400043.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">lowered</a> his price target to $75, indicating a 22% downside potential then. His team flagged the risk of \"fatigue\" in key Hasbro brands.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Newly Acquired Brands Could Propel Next Phase Of Growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What's comforting for investors is that Hasbro is not resting on its laurels. To address the potential \"fatigue,\" even as its key brands are high on the toys ranking, the company has been on the lookout for the broadening of its product ranges. On May 1, 2018, Hasbro announced a deal with Saban Properties to acquire Power Rangers and several other entertainment brands valued at $522 million. The acquisition was to be satisfied with a combination of $229.75 million in cash and the issue of $270 million worth of common stock. The other properties include <em>My Pet Monster, Popples, Julius Jr., Luna Petunia</em> and <em>Treehouse Detectives. </em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro Is Enhancing Its Digital Strategy And Direct-To-Customer Engagements</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To combat the loss of Toys \"R\" Us, Hasbro, the largest toy company in the world, has been creating exclusive products for online channels and programs to support its retailers. The efforts are not limited to traditional names like Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), but also includes participation in newer retail events such as JD.com's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JD\" title=\"JD.com, Inc.\">JD</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4177599-2-catalysts-emerging-for-alibaba-and-jd-com\">J.D. Day (618 shopping festival)</a>, Amazon\u2019s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) Prime Day and 11/11, Alibaba's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) Singles' Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Brian Goldner, CEO of Hasbro since May 2008, said the company has been investing in digital media and marketing to develop direct-to-consumer engagement around the world. I'm not going to simply take his word for it. A quick check at YouTube, a property of Alphabet's Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), showed that the official Hasbro channel has managed to snag 2.4 million subscribers with its 7833 videos as of August 1, 2018 (see the screenshots below). This is a 26 percent increase in subscriber numbers in less than four months. This is happening from a rather high base of nearly 2 million. What's even more admirable was that this feat was achieved with just a 12 percent increase in the number of videos uploaded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a

The recent earnings beat provided the fuel for a further spike upwards. The company has raised its dividend 14 times in the last 15 years, with the latest quarterly hike at 11 percent. It could see a rejuvenated sales growth with its acquisition of the Power Rangers brand, among other properties. A quick check at YouTube showed Hasbro managed to increase its subscriber numbers by 26 percent in less than four months. This is happening from a rather high base of nearly 2 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company believed its stock was undervalued in the second quarter. It repurchased 820,343 shares of common stock at a total cost of $74.1 million and an average price of $90.33 per share, which is around 10 percent lower than the prevailing price. All in, I believe that we can see further upside in Hasbro than the consensus price target at around $106 is suggesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What's your take?</strong> Do you think Hasbro's outlook is positive?
