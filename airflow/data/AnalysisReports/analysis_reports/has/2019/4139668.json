Two outlet stores are also closing.</p> <p>A declining U.S. birth rate has been weighing on many industries, particularly those dealing directly with infants and children.</p> <p>The Wayne, N.J.-based retailer surprised the industry by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 19, ahead of the holiday selling season, an especially critical time for toy stores.</p> <p><span>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had been laboring under $400 million a year in interest payments ever since a 2005 leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR &amp; Co. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KKR\" title=\"KKR &amp; Co. Inc.\">KKR</a></span>), and Vornado Realty Trust (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNO\" title=\"Vornado Realty Trust\">VNO</a></span>) that was valued at $7.5 billion.</span></p> <p>Liquidity concerns came to a head earlier than expected when <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/06/toys-r-us-weighs-possible-bankruptcy-filing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC reported</a> on September 6 that the company had hired restructuring attorneys Kirkland &amp; Ellis to address its debt.</p> <p>That news was enough to spook toymakers into cutting crucial holiday shipments and tightening payment terms at a time when the retailer could least afford it, as the toy seller needed extra cash for everything from seasonal hiring to a holiday ad blitz.</p> <p>Pushed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us reported in a December conference call that sales had already fallen by 7% before the news and that surveys found 17% of respondents<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> would change their shopping habits because of the bankruptcy. According to a December 18 </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-18/bankrupt-toys-r-us-is-said-to-mull-closing-at-least-100-stores\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bloomberg report</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, sales had since fallen by 15% year over year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Chief executive Dave Brandon said on the call that the experience was \u201cpretty stressful, pretty difficult and certainly had a negative impact on the business.\u201d Shipments were significantly interrupted, he added, especially in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">JAKKS Pacific (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" title=\"JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\">JAKK</a></span>), which licenses Disney and DC Comics toys, among others, said in an October 26 earnings call that it slowed, then \u201c<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4116895-jakks-pacifics-jakk-ceo-stephen-berman-on-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript\">briefly halted</a>\u201d shipments to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and that this was a major factor in a 13% year-over-year drop in sales for the company. JAKKS said it expects its $1.2 million profit in 2016 to swing into a loss. The company added that shipments were still \u201cmoving a bit slower than expected\u201d at the time of the call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Mattel Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a></span>) said it \u201cmade the difficult decision to begin to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4117159-mattel-mat-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript\">reduce shipments</a>\u201d to the retailer, and that it \u201ctook quite some time\u201d to restore its shipping volume. Mattel\u2019s revenues fell 8% year over year in the quarter ending September 30.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) said it \u201c<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4115536-hasbros-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript\">paused shipments</a> for a short period\u201d to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, negatively affecting revenues and operating profit, though its revenue was still up 7% year over year in the three months through October 1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In its bankruptcy petition, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said it owed unpaid invoices of $136 million to Mattel, $59 million each to Hasbro and Graco (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWL\" title=\"Newell Brands Inc.\">NWL</a></span>), $33 million to Spin Master Corp, and $14 million to JAKKS, among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The retailer\u2019s top unsecured creditor was Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BK\" title=\"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\">BK</a></span>), to which Toys \u201cR\u201d Us owed at least $230 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Judge Keith Phillips approved $21<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/370566-dollar-drops-to-3-year-low-after-mnuchin-praises-weak-us-currency\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> million in bonuses for Toys \"R\" Us executives, garnering public criticism. The U.S. trustee assigned to the case, Judy A. Robbins, said the idea of big bonuses for a bankrupt company \u201cdefies logic and wisdom.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And Kirkland &amp; Ellis\u2019 exceptionally steep rate of up to $1,745 an hour became a poster case for a bipartisan Senate effort to end the practice of bankruptcy venue shopping. The court in Richmond, Va., where Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed, has a reputation for being particularly obliging of high attorney's fees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Several retailers went bankrupt during the normally quiet period before the end of the year. In addition to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the bankruptcies included accessories seller Charming Charlie, as well as Styles for Less, Fashion to Figure, Shiekh Shoes, Sports Zone, and women's lifestyle retailer Calypso St. Barth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The early days of the new year have also seen the bankruptcies of Parker School Uniforms, women\u2019s apparel store A\u2019GACI, and the U.S. arm of cosmetics seller KIKO Milano.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outside of bankruptcy, Sears (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHLD\" title=\"VictoryShares Protect America ETF\">SHLD</a>), Kmart, Sam\u2019s Club (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a></span>), Starbucks\u2019 Teavana stores (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a></span>), Mattress Firm, Brookstone, Hallmark, J. Crew and CeX are among the retailers that have recently announced store closings, with many more that announced closures earlier in 2017 but held off until after Christmas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Vitamin World, already in bankruptcy, sought to close an additional 124 stores in November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Beyond retailers, 600 hair salons by Regis Corp.
