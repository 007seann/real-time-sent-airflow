It is our thesis that the company is entering the back half of a \"toy cycle,\" a concept we have covered many times where new products are released year-after-year piggybacking on successful movies, comics, shows and more. In this column, we will highlight a few key trends that you should be aware of as it pertains to our long-term bullish outlook. Further, we will offer our projections for 2018.</p> <h3>Top line disappoints</h3> <p>Despite the fact that share prices are rebounding today, sales actually fell in the fourth quarter. Take a look at the last three years of Q4 sales:</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-15180359580624678_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"1012\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-15180359580624678.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"463\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"463\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3zqC2i4fXAhXMSyYKHZSnDREQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.hasbro.com%2Fsec.cfm%3Fview%3Dall&amp;usg=AOvVaw3x21uMult2dJZQYeFuIMl4\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEC filings</a></p> <p>One of the challenges continues to be Toys R Us dealing with soft traffic. We think this played a strong part of overall toy sales being less than stellar this holiday season. In addition, Hasbro and the industry at large experienced an overall decline in consumer demand in November and December for toys in general versus the prior year, while a revenue decline in Partner Brands and in Europe weighed on overall results. Regardless of the recent pullback, we think Hasbro will be set to continue growing revenues as the toy cycle continues, as noted by the annual revenue growth:</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-15180359777206013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1396\" data-height=\"1014\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-15180359777206013.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: SEC filings</p> <p>The trend in sales here and from other companies having reported earnings reveals the consumer is still strong, but the holiday period this year did disappoint. For the quarter, we expected revenues of $1.8 billion, but these missed our expectations by $200 million. That said, the sales figure for the year is promising, and the trend supports our notion of the toy cycle contributing to sales growth. Annual revenues were $5.21 billion, with growth of 4% from last year. What<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> is more, for the year, revenues grew in all segments. We saw growth of 5% in the U.S. and Canada, as well as international growth of 2%. Entertainment and Licensing revenue saw a 7% gain versus last year. However, with the sell-off we need to look at earnings to ensure the company is growing profit.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Bottom line strong</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the stock has been volatile of late, and sales were weaker than we would have liked, the reality is the company is growing adjusted earnings per share. In fact, earnings have been growing over the last three years in Q4; this trend is positive:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-1518035991857855_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1389\" data-height=\"1018\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/7/3949741-1518035991857855.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"469\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"469\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: SEC filings</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The growth in earnings tells us that rising sales are not being offset by increased expenses to generate those sales. Net income came in at $291.2 million or $2.30 per share. This represents a massive improvement year-over-year in net income from last year\u2019s $207.4 million, or $1.64 per share. While revenues disappointed, earnings per share surpassed our estimates handily, mostly on the back of expense management, and increased share repurchase activity. Earnings per share have benefited from share repurchases, which were stepped up massively once again in the quarter.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Share repurchases impress</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As you know, share repurchases boost earnings per share by reducing share count. Hasbro had a strong buyback history in 2017. In fact, the company has been buying back shares consistently. In 2017 it purchased $155 million worth of stock. In addition, it has authorized more and more cash toward the repurchases. This drives up earnings per share, in addition to gains seen organically. It is worth noting that there is still $178 million remaining in the repurchased authorization. But wait, there\u2019s more.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A dividend hike</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is a dividend growth stock. While in recent years we viewed the stock under the guise of a growth play, with a small dividend, the yield is just under 2.5%. In addition, the company continues to raise its dividends. We were impressed with another <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3328772-hasbro-declares-0_63-dividend\">10.5% dividend hike</a> being announced, bringing the quarterly payout to $0.63 per share. While a near-2.5% yield will not get dividend investors diving in, it certainly will start to catch some attention. We like this yield, and at just 18 times trailing earnings, the dividend is attractive, especially considering our projections for 2018 growth.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">2018 projections</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The toy cycle continues, and we expect growth in 2018. In the past four years, Hasbro has grown revenues by almost $1 billion. Hasbro is in a strong financial position with $1.58 billion in cash, and only $150 million of short-term debt. Long-term debt is $1.6 billion, but we expect the company to chip away at this debt with rising sales and earnings, the latter which will see a benefit from tax reform in the U.S. For 2018, we are projecting mid-single-digit revenue growth. We are targeting $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion in revenues. On the bottom line, we expect a reduced share count, similar expense growth and a tax reform benefit to drive earnings per share higher. Based on our revenue projections, we are eyeing earnings of $5.60 to $5.85.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our take</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There is no doubt the holiday season 2017 disappointed, but the consumer is strong and the company has a solid pipeline, even as the toy cycle and the bull market ages. While there are concerns over partner sales in the future (e.g. Toys R Us), we believe the stock is a solid buy under $100 for continued growth, as well as a decent and growing dividend payout. We expect sales and earnings to grow in 2018. Hasbro is our top choice in this sector, and we expect it will continue to be a winner in the long run.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.
