In this column, we will highlight a few key trends that you should be aware of and update our projections for 2018.</p> <h3>Toys \"R\" Us weighs on sales</h3> <p>We came into this quarter expecting fully to see sales that would be down almost 10% given the fact that Toys \"R\" Us, a top volume outlet for Hasbro's toys, was closing its doors. Despite that fact, sales were stronger than expected, but still fell. Take a look at the last three years of Q2 sales:</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-15323758652238166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"680\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-15323758652238166.png\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"463\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3zqC2i4fXAhXMSyYKHZSnDREQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.hasbro.com%2Fsec.cfm%3Fview%3Dall&amp;usg=AOvVaw3x21uMult2dJZQYeFuIMl4\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEC filings</a>, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing</p> <p>With the absence of Toys \"R\" Us, the company will need to innovate and work to get its products into the hands of merchants and consumers moving forward. Amazon is one partner, but Amazon cuts into margins given there reach. Hasbro and the industry at large experienced an overall decline in consumer demand in Europe as well. </p> <p>The trend in sales here and from other companies having reported earnings reveals the consumer is still strong, but demand is slipping slightly. That said, the year is unfolding pretty much as expected. For the quarter, we expected revenues of $860-$870 million on the back of Toys \"R\" Us being gone, but our expectations were handily surpassed. This is because revenues came in at $904.5 million, surpassing our estimates by $44.5 million on the lower end of our range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sales were down both in the U.S. and Canada, as well as internationally. In the U.S. and Canada, net revenues decreased 7% to $459.3 million compared to $494.4 million last year, while operating margins expanded. The segment reported an operating profit of $76.2 million, or 16.6% of net revenues, compared to an operating profit of $81.6 million, or 16.5% of net revenues, in 2017. Again, the decline was Toys \"R\" Us related. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One positive for the top line was the Entertainment and Licensing segment. The Entertainment and Licensing segment saw net revenues increase 26% to $64.7 million compared to $51.5 million in 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Internationally, net revenues were $380.4 million, down 11%, compared to $426.6 million in 2017. Revenues in the segment were negatively impacted by weakness in Europe, including a push to turnover inventory. It has to be noted that the loss of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us revenues in many Europe and Asia Pacific markets weighed as well. Revenues were down everywhere. Europe net revenues decreased 16%, Latin America decreased 3% and Asia Pacific decreased 5%. Emerging markets net revenues also decreased 9% in the quarter. There is still reason to be positive however. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Bottom line strong</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Look there is no question that the top line was hit hard, but we were expecting worse, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. With the much better than expected overall sales, despite the declines, earnings were strong, though they declined from last year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-1532375929914858_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"924\" data-height=\"684\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-1532375929914858.png\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The decline in sales led to a decline in earnings. This stands to reason. In addition, a share repurchase program helped boost earnings per share. Factoring in expenses, we saw net income register at $60.3 million or $0.48 per share. This represents a notable but expected decline year-over-year in net income from last year\u2019s $67.7 million, or $0.53 per share. While these declines are certainly ugly on paper, the results were better than expected. Given the shareholder friendly nature of the company, in conjunction with the better than expected results, the bulls are out in force today,</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Shareholder friendly</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As you know, share repurchases boost earnings per share by reducing share count. Hasbro had a strong buyback history. In fact, the company has been buying back shares consistently. In this quarter alone, it purchased $74.1 million worth of stock. In addition, it has authorized more and more cash toward the repurchases. This drives up earnings per share, in addition to any gains seen organically. It is worth noting that there is still $565.1 million remaining in the repurchases authorization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What is also important to realize is that Hasbro is also a dividend growth stock. While in recent years we viewed the stock under the guise of a growth play, with a small dividend. However, the yield is just under 2.6%. In addition, the company continues to raise its dividends each year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-1532375639537289_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"932\" data-height=\"677\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/23/3949741-1532375639537289.png\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Data <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/has/dividend-history\" rel=\"nofollow\">from NASDAQ</a>, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We were impressed with another <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3328772-hasbro-declares-0_63-dividend\">10.5% dividend hike</a> being announced to start the year, bringing the quarterly payout to $0.63 per share. While a near-2.6% yield will not result in yield hunting dividend investors diving in, it certainly will start to catch some attention. We like this yield, and at just 18 times trailing earnings, the dividend is attractive, especially considering our projections for 2018 growth.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revising our 2018 projections</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The toy cycle continues, but the loss of a key partner in Toys \"R\" Us is being felt. Hasbro does have a strong financial position with $1.16 billion in cash, and only $20 million of short-term debt. Long-term debt is $1.69 billion, but we expect the company to chip away at this debt over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For 2018, we are now revising our expectations lower. We are targeting $5.3 billion to $5.45 billion in revenues, down from $5.4 to $5.6 billion. On the bottom line, we expect a reduced share count, similar expense growth and a tax reform benefit to drive earnings per share higher. Based on our revenue projections, we are eyeing earnings of $5.45 to $5.65, down from $5.60 to $5.85.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At the highest end of these expectations, we have a stock at $107.40 per share. This means the name is trading at 19 times 2018 earnings. In our opinion, this is a but expensive, especially after the 11% return we have had in shares since our buy call. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Take home</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is our top choice in this sector, but the name has gotten expensive at present levels. Let the name cool off, and we can revisit under $100. We are taking profits here at $107.40.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.
