Whilst this comparison is applicable to the U.S. only - the world's largest toy market - all anecdotal evidence suggests that the picture will not be much different internationally.</p> <p>The movie factor is important, but it is not the only one that negatively affects Hasbro's outlook for the quarter. The other factor is that new entrants are taking share away from the more established companies. This is how the sell-through weights applicable to Hasbro and its leading competitors provided by the buyers at the leading North American retailers - both brick-and-mortar and eCommerce - changed between November 2017 and November 2018:</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Category</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11/2017</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11/2018</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>+/-</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Hasbro</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Action Figures</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>34</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>27</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>(21%)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Mattel</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Action Figures</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>32</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>17</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>(47%)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>eOne</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Action Figures</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>7</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>8</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>+14%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Hasbro</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Fashion Dolls</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>29</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>18</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>(38%)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Mattel</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Fashion Dolls</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>28</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>+154%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Just Play</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Fashion Dolls</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>9</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>14</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>+55%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>MGAE</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Fashion Dolls</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>17</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>+70%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p>Source: Klosters Retailer Panel</p> <p>(Incidentally, whilst this information will undoubtedly be redundant for most of my readers, the editors of Seeking Alpha insist that I explain how I get the data for the Klosters Retailer Panel quoted<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> at the bottom of each of the chart above.

Hasbro's sell-through in the U.S. during October and November has basically been down by approximately 5% and will remain so unless things change dramatically in December. All feedback from national buyers tells me that there is nothing on the horizon that could provide this dramatic change. Hasbro's 2017 fourth quarter performance was already pretty disappointing and 2018 does not promise much better as a result.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Faces Tough Sledding This Fourth Quarter. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4224917-hasbro-faces-tough-sledding-this-fourth-quarter?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "48741", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "102761", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4224917-hasbro-faces-tough-sledding-this-fourth-quarter", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4224917-hasbro-faces-tough-sledding-this-fourth-quarter", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/11/27/435974-15433398906563144.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/11/27/435974-15433398906563144.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "48741", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "lutz-muller", "userId": 435974, "tagId": 102761, "bio": "Lutz is an acknowledged expert on the toy space.
