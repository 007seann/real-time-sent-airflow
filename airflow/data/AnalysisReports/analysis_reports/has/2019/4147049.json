What differentiates HAS from other toy companies is that it has developed a strong expertise in producing toys for others, notably Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>). Over the years, Hasbro has developed several popular brands with kids:</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId6.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"659\" data-height=\"202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId6_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"196\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: Hasbro Fact Sheet</p> <p>It is also the company behind Disney Princess, Marvel and Star Wars toys. As management is very well aware, kids enjoy playing on their PS4 or tablets more than playing with classic action figures. Hasbro has entered digital games with the acquisition of Backflip Studios (mobile game) and Boulder Media (animation studio). It can also count on a partnership with Activision Blizzard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATVI\">ATVI</a>) to stay up-to-date in the gaming world.</p> <h3><strong>An Eye On The Latest Quarter</strong></h3> <p><span>Non-GAAP EPS of $2.30, up by +40%, beat estimates by $0.50. <span>Revenue of $1.6B, down by -1.8%, missed estimates by $120M. <span>Dividend of $0.63/share, +11% increase.</span></span></span></p> <p><strong>What the CEO Said</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>\u201cHasbro\u2019s global team\u2019s execution of our Brand Blueprint drove revenue gains in Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands, including immersive brand experiences across consumer products and digital gaming. In the fourth quarter, Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues increased 11%. However, overall consumer demand slowed in November and December both for the industry and for Hasbro. Looking ahead, our innovative lines are supported by robust storytelling and digital initiatives that position us well for 2018 and beyond.\u201d</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What I Say</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro remains a very strong company, but the years of surprising growth may seem behind them. After all, there is a limit to the number of Star Wars action figures and Frozen princesses you can sell in a year. Its partner brands remain a strong segment, but will show smaller growth going forward (was -10% during last quarter). Nonetheless, HAS remains a strong dividend grower showing +13% CAGR over the past decade.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Growth Vectors</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId8.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId8_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Don\u2019t get fooled by the earnings drop as this includes a major charge of $297M due to the new tax reform. In fact, EPS jumped by 40% last quarter and it is up by 22% for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">You may think that classic toys are dying after we saw what is happening with Mattel and Toys\u201dR\u201dUs, but fear not; Hasbro's business is doing very well. In fact, its franchise brands continues to be a growth vector for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId9.png\" data-width=\"629\" data-height=\"351\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: HAS Q4 investor presentation</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As mentioned in my previous comment, the impressive success Hasbro had with Disney products over the past couple of years make sales difficult to be beat year after year. Even with a slowdown in this segment, I consider the division to be a growth vector for the future. Disney has built a never-ending content universe where new movies will out come each year. Therefore, new toys will be designed and sold by Hasbro. There will be ups and downs, but nobody gets tired of princesses and the force!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the middle class is rising among emerging markets, chances are classic toys will be in demand in the upcoming years. Children are all dreaming of those characters and will be happy to have their own action figures at home.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, the company has a history of growing through smart acquisitions. The company could benefit from Mattel\u2019s position of weakness to make an offer and dominate the toy industry across the world. It could also expand further into the digital world with more acquisitions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dividend Growth Perspective</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After taking a pause with its dividend growth policy in 2009, Hasbro has positioned itself as a super-powered dividend grower. In 2018, HAS will celebrate its 9<sup>th</sup> consecutive year with a dividend raise. This makes it 1 year away from making the elite Dividend Achievers list. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully <strong>increased their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years</strong>. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the <a href=\"https://www.thedividendguyblog.com/2017/06/22/dividend-achievers-list-dividend-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId11.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId11_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On top of providing a steady dividend payment, management is also aggressively increasing it. The company shows a 9.51% dividend CAGR over the past 5 years and rewarded shareholders once again with an 11% this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId12.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId12_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the company benefits from many tailwinds and both payout ratios are well under control, shareholders can sleep on both ears. In fact, I expect double-digit dividend growth for many years to come.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro may be done with the incredible growth Disney products have generated over the past decade. The overall excitement around those toys is not the same anymore. This doesn\u2019t mean there will be no growth from this segment, but I don\u2019t expect double-digit growth anymore. Hasbro will have to continue searching for additional contracts to keep up the same pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Also, a more important switch toward digital gaming and toys will be important to insure the business sustainability over the long haul. Classic toys will eventually fade as digital ones are taking over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, Toy\u201dR\u201dUs's financial challenges will not affect the company too much as it represents about 9% of its sales. However, this could give additional negotiation power to other retailers such as Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>). Those retailers represent a very important part of HAS sales on U.S. soil.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When you ignore the special items charged to reduce HAS EPS, the stock doesn\u2019t look that expensive after all. In fact, considering the rest of the market, HAS may be trading at a discount!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId13.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/106145_15187006820946_rId13_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I\u2019ve updated my dividend discount model calculations to reflect the company\u2019s latest generous increase. I continue to believe the company can achieve a double-digit dividend growth rate for the upcoming decade. This leaves us with Hasbro trading at a very interesting price right now.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Input Descriptions for 15-Cell Matrix</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>INPUTS</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p>Enter Recent Annual Dividend Payment:</p></td> <td><p>$2.52</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p>Enter Expected Dividend Growth Rate Years 1-10:</p></td> <td><p>10.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p>Enter Expected Terminal Dividend Growth Rate:</p></td> <td><p>7.50%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p>Enter Discount Rate:</p></td> <td><p>10.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"3\"><p><strong>Discount Rate (Horizontal)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Margin of Safety</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>9.00%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10.00%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>11.00%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>20% Premium</strong></p></td> <td><p>$269.25</p></td> <td><p>$160.27</p></td> <td><p>$113.63</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>10% Premium</strong></p></td> <td><p>$246.81</p></td> <td><p>$146.92</p></td> <td><p>$104.16</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Intrinsic Value</strong></p></td> <td><p>$224.38</p></td> <td><p><strong>$133.56</strong></p></td> <td><p>$94.69</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>10% Discount</strong></p></td> <td><p>$201.94</p></td> <td><p>$120.20</p></td> <td><p>$85.22</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>20% Discount</strong></p></td> <td><p>$179.50</p></td> <td><p>$106.85</p></td> <td><p>$75.75</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Please read the <a href=\"https://www.dividendmonk.com/dividend-discount-model-limitations-and-how-to-manage-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dividend Discount Model limitations</a> to fully understand my calculations.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Final Thought</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS went through its fair share of challenges in 2017. The retail industry is having problems, MAT going down (and inviting investors to get rid of the other players at the same time) and finally the tax reform. While the market was booming, Hasbro was going sideways. The stock is currently attractively priced and shareholders will continue to enjoy a strong dividend growth doubled with a constant share buy-back program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Seriously, if you made it this far, it\u2019s because you liked what you read.
