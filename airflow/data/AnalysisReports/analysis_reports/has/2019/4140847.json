It is the consumer who is sick and tired of paying through his or her nose to watch a lot of drivel mixed with equally bad commercials. He or she is moving away from cable and is going to streaming providers such as Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>), which offers the choice of being able to see what you want to see, when you want to see it and this without commercials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, there are all the newcomers \u2013 consumers who have never even bothered to watch traditional TV. This is how the trend developed for both groups since 2016:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/28/435974-15171725014309783.png\" data-width=\"587\" data-height=\"599\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">UBS took another crack at the same subject \u2013 they estimated how many viewers traditional TV providers lost between 2012 and 2016 and how many Streaming TV gained in the same time span:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/28/435974-15171725492736225.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"484\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">You can assume that it was the adults in the household who took the decision to cut the cord, or never to tie it, and that the children of the family just went with the flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the case of Cinemas, there is the individual who just stays at home and watches his or her preferred movies from their couch and you can assume that the kids in this household do exactly the same:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/28/435974-15171725996243067.png\" data-width=\"555\" data-height=\"625\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In both cases, the clear winners are the Streaming Services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to Internet World Stats, the U.S. had on 6/30/2017 an internet user population of 286.9 million, which equals 88% of the total population. ComScore on 4/10/2017 and Ad Age on 1/9/2018 estimated the number of streaming subscribers at 146 million, broken down as follows amongst the top five Streaming Services:</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </h3> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><h3>Company</h3></td> <td><h3>Number of Subscribers</h3></td> <td><h3>U.S. Market Share</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>Netflix</h3></td> <td><h3>53 million</h3></td> <td><h3>36.30%</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>YouTube/Google</h3></td> <td><h3>31 million</h3></td> <td><h3>21.23%</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>DirecTV/AT&amp;T</h3></td> <td><h3>25 million</h3></td> <td><h3>17.12%</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>Amazon</h3></td> <td><h3>20 million</h3></td> <td><h3>13.70%</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>Hulu/Fox</h3></td> <td><h3>17 million</h3></td> <td><h3>11.65%</h3></td> </tr> <tr> <td><h3>Total</h3></td> <td><h3>146 million</h3></td> <td><h3>100.00%</h3></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What does this mean for Mattel and Hasbro?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It means that their main drivers \u2013 be that big screen movies or films aired on Cable TV \u2013 are losing core toy consumers \u2013 the kids \u2013 at an accelerating rate. This would not matter if the same kids were again picked up at the Streaming Services but this is not the case.. None of the current blockbusters are being shown on Streaming Services \u2013 no Last Jedi, no Justice League, no Thor Ragnarok, no Transformers The Last Knight, and no Spiderman Homecoming 2. The same applies to Cable TV Series \u2013 no Star Wars Rebels, no Marvel Spiderman, no Guardians, no Tangled or Elena of Avalor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Yes, the Streaming Services do show toy-related films but just not those that help Mattel or Hasbro. Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) shows Sesame Street, Dora and Lego Star Wars; Hulu carries Sesame Street. Netflix shows a ton of Disney movies but just not those released last year. If you talk to national buyers at the large retailers, they will tell you that the toy-draw today of 2016 movies or earlier ones is minimal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The toy companies could of course counteract all this by shifting advertising dollars to the Streaming Services. There is only one problem with this. Netflix does not accept ads. Hulu, YouTube (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Amazon offer ad-free services and these are growing much more rapidly than the ad-offering variety. DirecTV (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) has only ad-versions now but is apparently considering the non-ad version as well. The reason for this is simple. Parents tend to dislike ads directed at children. The American Psychological Association had the following to say on the subject:</p> <blockquote class=\"quote paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The more fundamental concern regarding the effects of advertising on children relates to questions of potential harm resulting from exposure. A variety of research findings are relevant to this issue. Several studies, for example, have found that parent\u2013child conflicts occur commonly when parents deny their children's product purchase requests that were precipitated by advertising.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>According to GeekWire, </em>Netflix, and other services with kid-specific offerings like Amazon Video and Hulu, make it much easier for parents to control their kids\u2019 entertainment options. They offer an easy way to keep a child entertained with no commercial interruption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This leaves the Toy industry in a real quandary because with films becoming less of a driver, advertising becomes more important. Statista quantified this in a chart given below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Leading toys and games-related products advertised on TV in the United States in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter 2017, by number of occurrences</strong>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/28/435974-15171726681764457.png\" data-width=\"628\" data-height=\"980\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There is another factor that has a bearing on this \u2013 is TV advertising still worth doing? According to Steve Byrne in his book \u201cA Profile of the United States Toy Industry, Second Edition: Serious Fun\u201d this is debatable. He says that</p> <blockquote class=\"quote paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>\u201cAnd there is another issue to consider: return of investment. When scheduled TV was the dominant medium reaching children, the advertising to sales ration was tremendous. The general rule of thumb was that for every dollar spend on advertising, it was possible to forecast 20 dollars in sales. Today, this number is significantly less, coming in about 5 dollars for every dollar spent.\u201d</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, what is a toy manufacturer to do? One way is of course to go back to the basics and to rely less on films and TV advertising to do your job and more on own innovation. There are a great many products out there that do incredibly well because they are new, and fresh, and different. Hatchimals, LOL, Enchantimals, Fingerlings, P J Masks, MC2, JoJo Siwa and Roblox come to mind. They are not simply plastic replicas of movie actors or old tired Barbies in a new pair of shoes but are genuinely the end result of an incredible creative effort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The other avenue is to change the fundamental model. This is what Disney is trying to do in its acquisition of Fox, which gives it control over Hulu. It lets Disney yank all its films from Netflix by 2019 and move them over to Hulu. By doing so, Disney will have the choice of airing all the newest Disney and Fox blockbusters not only in Cinemas and Cable TV but also on its own Streaming Service. This will then give Hasbro, as the probable licensee of all this great movie IPs, a solid entry into the Streaming world \u2013 an entry which neither they nor Mattel have today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This, unfortunately, leaves Mattel out in the cold and at a very significant competitive disadvantage. The company will face essentially two choices. It can either try to get more Disney/Fox licenses similar to CARS and Avatar and so hitch a ride on Hulu or it can go back to basics and rely on product innovation to drive its business.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">One thing is for certain. The toy industry is in for a very rough ride. Between the accelerating shift from brick-and-mortar stores to online retail, and from Cinemas and Cable TV to Streaming services, the relatively placid world in which toy manufacturers now live is undergoing fundamental change. It will be interesting to see who is left standing at the end of this decade.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS $MAT - Children Are Giving Cable TV And Cinemas A Miss And This Is Bad News For Both Hasbro And Mattel. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4140847-children-are-giving-cable-tv-and-cinemas-miss-and-this-is-bad-news-for-hasbro-and-mattel?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><em><strong>Get insider insights on the toy industry...</strong></em></p><p>With more than three decades of insider experience as an executive in the toy industry, I have the ability to spot trends before they manifest, and discern key opportunities for investors.
