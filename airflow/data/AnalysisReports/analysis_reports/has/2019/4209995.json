Subsequently, the share price of Hasbro hit a 52-week high of $109.60, but it has given back much of the gains to settle at $100.75 at the time of writing. I believe there is potential for the shares to rebound and will explain why in this article.</p> <h3>Riding On The Craze Over The Popular Fortnite Game</h3> <p>In September, Hasbro revealed that it had formed a partnership with Epic Games (in which Tencent (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCTZF\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCTZF</a>) owns a 40 percent stake) to introduce a variety of products specific to the popular game <em>Fortnite</em>. Hasbro president Jonathan Berkowitz described the game as a \u201ccultural phenomenon with legions of players worldwide\u201d. The battle royale megahit has millions of players <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/7409763/fortnite-is-a-worldwide-megahit-but-the-battle-royale-bubble-is-about-to-burst/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hooked</a> globally and has brought its developer \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars. The founder of Epic Games is now reportedly a billionaire. The collaboration allows Hasbro to ride on the popularity of the game and increase the demand for its NERF guns.</p> <p>The game\u2019s success is not simply due to the fact that it\u2019s fun to play, but there are features that make it addictive. For instance, there are articles <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/articles/is-fortnite-a-tech-addiction-threat\" rel=\"nofollow\">stating</a> the need to keep playing consistently, as skipping Fortnite for just one day can \u201cdramatically reduce\u201d the player\u2019s \u201cmuscle memory\u201d at the controls. The player is rewarded with \u201cfun and flashy\u201d images for each win in the game, creating a mental \u201creward\u201d that encourages him to keep returning. Continuous play is not healthy, a situation that the Chinese government has taken note of and has clamped down on new game approvals recently, negatively impacting game companies like Tencent. For the self-aware or those encouraged by their loved ones to take a break from playing, the NERF guns are a good alternative to still stay somewhat \u201cconnected\u201d to the game. Having<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> specific products for Fortnite would enhance the \u201cconnection\u201d.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">NERF FECs - A Wholly Immersive And True Play Experience For The First Time Ever</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is not the first time that the company has tapped on a partner to collaborate on its NERF blasters. On February 8, Hasbro <a href=\"https://www.kingsmen-int.com/kingsmen-and-hasbro-announce-plans-to-open-nerf-family-entertainment-center-attractions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">entered</a> into a licensing agreement with Kingsmen Xperience, Inc., a US-based subsidiary of Kingsmen Creatives (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMNCF\" title=\"Kingsmen Creatives Ltd.\">OTCPK:KMNCF</a>), to create, build, and operate NERF family entertainment center (\u201cFEC\u201d) attractions across the Asia-Pacific. The collaboration with Kingsmen would be the first time ever that the NERF franchise offers \u201ca wholly-immersive and true play experience\u201d for \u201cfans of all ages\u201d.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The fast-growing middle-class population (350 million strong) in China serves as a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4146520-kingsmen-creatives-buying-opportunity-ahead-of-hasbro-boost\">large potential market for the NERF FECs</a> to be developed by Kingsmen Creatives. The NERF FECs would not just be a place for gun shooting. Each standalone indoor entertainment facility is expected to feature multiple activity zones, merchandising, and food &amp; beverage areas. The multi-faceted facility would serve to engage the entire family.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Is Gone For Now, But Its Return Would Be Beneficial To Toy Companies</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The unfortunate turn of events at Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us had negatively impacted toy companies for more than a year. With the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/toys-r-us-closing-sales-stores-retail-toys.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">complete</a> closure of the more than 800 stores across America at the end of June this year, the full-blown impact to Hasbro should have already been manifested in Q2 and the prior quarters. There have been <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/7/5/17534912/walmart-impeach-trump-shirts-boycott-threats-amazon-toy-catalog-facebook-scotus-treadmill-desk\" rel=\"nofollow\">talks </a>of Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) filling in the shoes of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us with its publication of a printed toy catalog intended for distribution out of its Whole Foods stores. Yet, it is obvious that the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/lenders-wants-to-revive-toys-r-us-andbabies-r-us-brands.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">possible resurrection </a>of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us would still be beneficial for toy companies, including Hasbro. The Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Inc. lenders were working on resuscitating the brand, according to new court documents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While any comeback by Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us would not see the retailer be as influential as in the past, its physical presence would require inventory and, of course, generate sales for Hasbro. This would be revenue that is probably not factored into market estimates. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us is also not just another retailer for toy companies. When it was still operational, its stores served as a showcase for new products. Its demise was greatly lamented. Surely its resurrection, even in a limited form, should be beneficial to Hasbro and celebrated.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Mini Baby Boom From A Possible End Of Birth Limits in China</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-move-points-to-possible-end-of-birth-limits-1.4088372\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> that China is removing three agencies tasked with enforcing family planning policies. This reignited speculations that the Chinese government is planning to completely scrap nearly four-decade-long restrictions on the number of children its citizens can have. This would be a further easing of the policies which have already seen some <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2137094/china-puts-end-its-notorious-one-child-policy-enforcer\" rel=\"nofollow\">relaxation</a> in the past year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The actual increase in the number of newborns is likely much <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/china-looks-to-relax-two-child-policy-but-it-wont-solve-demographic-problems-102518\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower</a> than the full intended take-up of the limit removal, given the constraints posed by women\u2019s rising career aspirations, cost of living, as well as other structural issues. Nevertheless, the scrapping of birth restrictions in China is a welcome move for toy companies long resigned to seeing declining birth rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/4/saupload_1536823492774171.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"705\" data-height=\"470\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/4/saupload_1536823492774171_thumb1.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investor Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the second quarter, Hasbro had repurchased 820,343 shares of common stock at an average price of $90.33 per share, for a total cost of $74.1 million. This is about 15 percent lower than the prevailing price, a reflection of the management\u2019s savviness in appreciating the undervaluation of the business then, and thereby establishing a pseudo floor price for the shares. I take the consensus price target at around $108.80 to be the potential upside, which is quite limited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/10/4/saupload_f1bf109facbad2e969e45c32b2e4c07a.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">HAS data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nevertheless, should there be a successful resurrection of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, that could serve as a catalyst for analysts to revise their target price upwards and spur the actual trading price to move higher. Contributions from Hasbro\u2019s partnerships are probably ignored by analysts at the moment due to the lack of visibility of sales. However, should there be a better-than-expected demand for such joint efforts, the additional revenue could provide the boost for earnings surprises and, consequently, the share price. On a longer horizon, the possible total scrapping of birth restrictions in China is positive for Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What's your take?</strong> Are you bullish or bearish?
