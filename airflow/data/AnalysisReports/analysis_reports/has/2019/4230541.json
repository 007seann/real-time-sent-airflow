Recently, the stock has come under pressure. Here's the chart (current at the time of writing):</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/12/27/saupload_930512bf8453fa5adc9e40d53d0c63c5.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"389\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\">HAS data by YCharts</figure></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That $78 price is closer to the 52-week low (again, time of writing) of $76.84 than the high of $109.60. No one likes that type of price action. Hasbro, however, should be investigated by potential shareholders at this point. There are three main reasons for this:</p> <ul> <li>Dividend yield</li> <li>Brand equity and ability to not only generate compelling toys/collectibles but to also acquire valuable licenses that have the potential to generate good returns</li> <li>Eventual move into an aggressive filmed-entertainment strategy (largest risk)</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will use this article to present, in brief, an overall positive thesis on the stock.</p> <h2>Dividend Yield</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dividend yield is currently over 3%. If you look at current cash flow levels, admittedly, it doesn't look so solid. Operational cash flow was about $175 million over the last three quarters versus $202 million in the comparable period, according to the latest earnings release. Capital spending was flat at $104 million, but dividend payments increased from $206 million to $230 million (again, over the nine-month period). Adding the dividend payment and the capital investment, obviously, fully wipes out the operational cash flow and creates a deficit.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's look at recent cash flow history from the <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/151365c7-d90c-4f88-967f-a46f52b62e6e\" rel=\"nofollow\">annual report</a> for 2017, page 54. Cash from operations for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 was approximately $570 million, $817 million, and $724 million, respectively. Capital spending in those same respective years was basically relatively steady at $142 million, $155 million, and $135 million. Dividends paid: $226 million, $249 million, $277 million. The controlled capital investment, coupled with the increasing cash flow, helped to power the dividend.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cash flow can vary from year to<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> year, especially during different business cycles and disruptive events. I believe Hasbro will do fine with its dividend growth over time. This year it was hit with the Toys R Us disappearance. The company also arguably was affected by possible </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> fatigue. I would not consider the current cash flow indicative of a negative long-term trend, for reasons I will now discuss.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Brand Equity/Toymaking Experience</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is a valuable trademark. Consumers associate the name with quality toys and assign the brand a high level of equity. The company develops its own toy IP as well as engaging the licensing business. A cycle of consumption occurs as families hand down the tradition of buying toys and gadgets for subsequent generations. Management has a lot of data on the act of gift-giving, play habits, and collecting/display behavior.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company also has access to core brands (e.g., board games like Monopoly) that generate recurring revenue that allows for research and development that can not only lead to the realization of new IP but also to short-term fad-type products that can boost sales. Such volatility does run the risk of creating a not-so-smooth curve on the cash flow graph, but like other IP businesses, any given year will be different (just ask any Hollywood-studio head).</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the company's <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/corporate\" rel=\"nofollow\">corporate site</a> makes clear right up front, brands power the business/stock. Whether it's a licensed brand or an in-house one, the company bets on trademarks and the public's familiarity/demand for them. The company goes after both genders with separate toy lines, such as Baby Alive dolls and Beyblade, and has ones that appeal to both, like Play-Doh. Furthermore, this is the company behind <em>Transformers</em>, which is a valuable multimedia property. The most exciting licensing partnership is with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) for the aforementioned <em>Star Wars</em> toys, but the company also distributes figures/dolls based on Marvel characters and the <em>Frozen</em> universe.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This isn't to say there can't be volatility, as I've mentioned. From the Q3 earnings report, we see that Franchise Brand sales (this includes owned-IP items like Monopoly, Nerf, etc.) decreased 5%. Partner Brands went down 37%. Emerging Brands, a very interesting category, increased slightly by 2%. The Emerging Brands segment includes items that are newly developed or are previously known but in need of a reboot; management describes this as an entrepreneurial segment (page 4 of the 2017 10-K), where new ideas can be hatched and/or applied to existing IP. This mix of categories amply describes the brand model.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Filmed Entertainment</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Here is the biggest opportunity for the company, in my opinion, one that has not been amply exploited yet - filmed entertainment.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro Studios is the television-content arm of the company (page 3 of the 2017 10-K). The company also owns a film label, Allspark Pictures, and a cartoon outfit called Allspark Animation. The company distributes content on several platforms and even has an interest in Discovery Family Channel. The annual report makes clear that the company values storytelling as a viable asset. I do, as well, and believe storytelling will be a big market in the future for many companies like Hasbro, given all the momentum in the streaming industry (i.e., I don't believe it is played out yet).</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Allspark film unit helped to produce <em>Ouija: Origin of Evil</em>, based on the classic board game. Allspark was also involved with the latest <em>Transformers</em> spinoff, <em>Bumblebee</em>, playing in theaters now. Hasbro is benefitting from the <em>Transformers</em> franchise, in terms of both profit participation and marketing for the toy lines, but the big money will eventually come from increasing the number of projects the company self-produces with its own financing. This is how Marvel, when it was a private outfit, became so valuable. It is impossible for me to consider that Hasbro won't explore that option in a bigger way than it is now. When that happens, the stock should react positively. In fact, recall that Hasbro tried to buy DreamWorks Animation, now owned by Comcast (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMCSA\" title=\"Comcast Corporation\">CMCSA</a>), and it also attempted <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3284556-hasbro-lower-lions-gate-up-after-merger-talks-break-down\">to merge</a> with Lions Gate Entertainment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LGF.A\" title=\"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.\">LGF.A</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LGF.B\" title=\"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.\">LGF.B</a>). This should signal to current/potential shareholders that the company will eventually participate in some transformative media deal in the future. The company could even try to do a deal with a private business. Perhaps some entity like Archie Comic Publications might be an interesting idea for a company like Hasbro, especially given that Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) took over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4096329-what-netflix-gets-millarworld-including-challenges\">Millarworld</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation/Conclusion</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let me bullet-point the Hasbro thesis:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The company's stock currently has a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/dividends/scorecard\">dividend yield</a> over 3%.</li> <li>The dividend has increased over the last five years at a growth rate of 5%.</li> <li>The P/E ratio is 18, on par with the S&amp;P 500's P/E value. That may not signal super-cheap, so take that into account, but my preference, in this case, is to focus on the yield.</li> <li>Hasbro is a typical high-brand-equity concern that generates positive cash flow based on its portfolio and should be able to expand current cash flow levels in the years ahead once it adjusts to a post-Toys-R-Us world. It's not much different than buying a foodstuffs product at a decent yield. The only difference is we are talking toys/IP instead of snacks/beverages. Consumers will always buy toys as gifts and collectibles.</li> <li>In the near future, Hasbro will most likely further expose itself to storytelling. This will involve a higher degree of self-financed filmed entertainment. This will hedge against the retail toy business while simultaneously explore growth/merger opportunities. I would not be surprised to see Hasbro try again for Lions Gate, or pursue smaller, private acquisitions. This is the biggest risk of the thesis, as it may be something that might reach critical mass later than expected.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Please perform your own due diligence before buying any stock.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Thesis: Yield, Brand Equity, And Content Make Stock Attractive. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4230541-hasbro-thesis-yield-brand-equity-and-content-make-stock-attractive?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "82146", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "2991", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "490846", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4230541-hasbro-thesis-yield-brand-equity-and-content-make-stock-attractive", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4230541-hasbro-thesis-yield-brand-equity-and-content-make-stock-attractive", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/12/27/saupload_930512bf8453fa5adc9e40d53d0c63c5.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/12/27/saupload_930512bf8453fa5adc9e40d53d0c63c5.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "82146", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "steven-mallas", "userId": 393777, "tagId": 490846, "bio": "I have previously written articles for The Motley Fool, TheStreet, and AOLs BloggingStocks.I also write fiction.
