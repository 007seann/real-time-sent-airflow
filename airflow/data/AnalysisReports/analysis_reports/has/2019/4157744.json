From a softer than expected <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3328777-soft-toy-demand-impacts-hasbro-in-q4\">fourth quarter</a> report to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3338953-toys-r-us-prepares-plan-to-liquidate\">liquidation announcement</a> from Toys 'R' Us, the company's stock price has continued to fall. Since peaking at $116.20 in July, the stock has lost 23.8% of its value. However, the company continues to show optimism after raising its dividend by 11% to continue its annual dividend growth streak to 16 years. Might this be the time to play around with HAS? Let's take a look.</p> <h3><strong>Where are we?</strong></h3> <p>Although I have already alluded to what the market has done to the stock, let's see how it compares to its history. Its current PE varies depending on which EPS you choose to use as a result of the US tax reform. In this case, HAS either has a PE of 16.2 or 28.4. I'll explain more about this in the \"Where are we going?\" section but needless to say I will focus on the 16.2 price to earnings ratio. With that in mind, HAS is currently trading below both its 5-year average of 21.6 (according to YCharts) and its 10-year history of 17.9 (according to <a href=\"https://gurufocus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gurufocus.com</a>). In comparison, HAS' PE is also below the market's 25.8 and the industry's 22.7.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/3/16/5779381-15212495377301316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1007\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/3/16/5779381-15212495377301316.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"123\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/HRL/pe_ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></p> <p>From another perspective, HA<span>S' dividend yield has increased since reaching a low of 2.10% in 2017. Thanks to the pullback, the yield now stands at 2.84% which is greater than it has been for the past 2 years but still far from its high of 4%. In comparison, the dividend yield is nicely above the toys and games industry average of 1.68% and the market's 1.87%.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/3/16/5779381-15212495378278532_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"394\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/3/16/5779381-15212495378278532.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"252\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-has/hasbro\" rel=\"nofollow\">SimplyWall.St</a></p> <p>The earnings yield is a quick method to determine the valuation of a stock.

I enjoy applying what I have learned particularly in my writing here on Seeking Alpha.
