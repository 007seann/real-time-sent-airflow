Morningstar estimates that Hasbro controls more than 10% of the toy industry\u2019s $25 billion in annual sales. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4114269-2-dividend-paying-companies-worth-considering\">last time I looked at Hasbro</a> was right before the company reported third quarter earnings. I am looking at the company again because games, toys and dolls are a popular gift to give during the holidays. Deloitte\u2019s holiday survey showed that <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/us-cb-holiday-survey-report-2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">39% of consumers</a> plan to give games, toys and dolls as gifts this year, up from 29% in 2012. In that same survey, respondents told Deloitte that toys will consume <a href=\"https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/industry/retail-distribution/holiday-retail-sales-consumer-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost 20% of holiday gift giving budgets</a>. As I\u2019ve said before, Hasbro\u2019s brands and licensing agreements are very popular among shoppers. With popular brands and a large percentage of consumers expected to purchase toys this holiday season, Hasbro has an opportunity to continue to grow its sales. I've been bullish on Hasbro for some time. After reviewing the company's third quarter earnings report, I continue to think that Hasbro has a vast runway for growth. Let's take a look at the company to see why I think so.</p> <h3>3rd Quarter Results</h3> <p>Hasbro reported earnings on 10/23/2017. Earnings per share in the quarter came in at $2.05. This figured topped estimates by 11 cents. Revenue was strong in the quarter, growing 6.5% year over year to just under $1.8 billion. This was slightly above analysts' estimates by $10 million. Revenues grew 7% compared to Q3 2016. For the year, revenues are also up 7% from this time last year. U.S., Canada and International markets both saw 7% revenue growth. Russia and China showed particular strength, growing sales 8% during the third quarter. Hasbro has just recently started selling products in India.
