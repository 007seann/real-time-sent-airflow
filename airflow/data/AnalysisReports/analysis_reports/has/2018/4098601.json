While the primary focus of that article was on Disney releasing a new <em>Star Wars </em>film every year until at 2020, it would be wise of investors to look at the potential long-term growth opportunity in Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>).</p> <p>In October 2012 when Disney purchased Lucasfilm, the company announced that 3 new films (Episodes VII-XI) would be released over next few years. To heighten <em>Star Wars</em> fan's anticipation even more, in February 2013, Bob Iger announced that Walt Disney also planned to release two standalone films These films would focus on origin stories within the <em>Star Wars </em>universe (<em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> was released in December 2016 to kick-off the series). While movie releases often drive investors to focus on ticket sales, I've decided to take another approach and look at a company with a strategic licensing agreement in place: Hasbro.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/8/9/47306589-15023016745238967.png\" data-width=\"200\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <h3> </h3> <p><a href=\"https://seeklogo.com/vector-logo/241282/hasbro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hasbro Logo Vector (.AI) Free Download</a></p> <h3>Hasbro</h3> <p>Since the early '90's, Hasbro has held the exclusive rights to create action figures based on the <em>Star Wars </em>saga. The success of the <em>Star Wars </em>franchise has helped Hasbro expand into new products lines and develop key revenue source. The <em>Star Wars</em> film series has become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. Look back on the toy makers stock price since 1990, Hasbro has seen tremendous growth. Focusing in on the last decade Hasbro's stock has grown by nearly 283%.

Focusing in on the company's stock performance before and after a </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars </em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">film release is interesting. When the 3 films of the prequel trilogy were released in the late 90's and early 2000's, Hasbro's stock saw minimal, if no, stock growth. I would likely attribute this sluggish stock movement to the release dates. All three films were released in late spring, whereas recent films have been released closer to the holiday season. Movies releases during the holiday season = increased toy sales. When analyzing Hasbro's stock performance due to more recent releases, the stock price has increased dramatically over the months following a new film. Can we say then that the release of new </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Star Wars</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> films has an impact on Hasbro's stock price? From a technical analysis standpoint, I would say absolutely based on the past few years of data. Could Hasbro's stock surge's simply be from holidays sales however? Most definitely. But we can't forget other key drivers that are pushing Hasbro's stock price up.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro vs Mattel</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There are currently two large toy manufacturers that hold a large majority of the market share: Hasbro and Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>). As mentioned above, Hasbro has seen a 43% return on its stock since the start of the new year. The current return on Mattel stock since the beginning of the year is -48%. So why exactly has Hasbro's stocked surged over the past 8 months while Mattel has drove investors <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2017/08/11/10-top-stocks-analysts-want-you-to-sell-now/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">to sell</a>? Licensing. We've already reviewed how much of an impact <em>Star Wars</em> has had on Hasbro so there is no need to reiterate just how import that licensing agreement is. Hasbro however holds other key licensing agreements that will also drive revenues over the next few years. A few key brands that Hasbro has manufacturing rights to are the <em>Disney Princess</em> and <em>Disney Frozen</em> lines, <em>Marvel</em>, and <em>Transformers</em>. For a full list of brands under Hasbro feel free to check out the company's <a href=\"https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> (I'm sure there are several brands that you will recognize. But these brands are what I find to be the key difference between a successful toy-maker like Hasbro and Mattel. Many of Hasbro's key licensing deals rely on film releases but luckily for Hasbro, most film franchises that the company is currently associated with are expecting a release in the next year or two. New movie releases ultimately means more toy sales and we all know what that will likely mean for the stock price.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Long Position Proposition</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investors should consider taking a long position on Hasbro. The company's stock price has climbed nearly 56% since the release of <em>The Force Awakens </em>in 2015. Now consider the fact that a new <em>Star Wars </em>film is set to be released every year up until 2019. Can you see the dollar signs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/8/12/47306589-15025148041749318.png\" data-width=\"182\" data-height=\"256\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Am-I-the-only-one-to-remember-the-Monopoly-man-with-a-monocle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Am I the only one to remember the Monopoly man with a monocle?</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Heavy emphasis should be put on Hasbro's licensing agreements as investors look towards the next few years. Hasbro has created a niche market solely based on its strategic alliances with big-time film franchises like <em>Star Wars</em>, the <em>Marvel</em> film series, and other <em>Disney </em>films.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In conclusion, Hasbro looks like a solid investment for passive investors as Mattel continues to struggle in a competitive market while licensing deals along with traditional brands push Hasbro's stock up.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Let's Talk About Toys. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4098601-talk-toys?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "103563", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "191133", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1748", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "86", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "576397", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4098601-talk-toys", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4098601-talk-toys", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/8/9/47306589-15023016745238967.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/8/9/47306589-15023016745238967.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "103563", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "stephen-giroux", "userId": 47306589, "tagId": 576397, "bio": "<p>Hello, thanks for visiting.
