The stock, which is still up 35% year-to-date, looks interesting here. The valuation isn't great, but <span>it's not bad, and there are multiple operational tailwinds in the back-half of the year which will likely power revenue and earnings out-performance. Overall, we aren't overly bullish on HAS stock given valuation concerns, but we are cautiously optimistic that today's sell-off offers good risk-reward for long-term investors.</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/24/saupload_8bc06d490b466237d6d7190ac49065bd.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\">HAS data by YCharts</p> <p>The quarter was a classic case of investor expectations being set too high. HAS has developed a pattern of always beating Street estimates. So when HAS narrowly beat topline estimates this quarter, investors weren't impressed. It was the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbros-sales-profit-beat-powered-105459451.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">smallest topline beat</a> HAS stock has had in a year and a half, and it came on the heels of a huge run higher in the stock. Moreover, heading into the report, HAS stock was as richly valued as it had been over the past 3 years. A narrow sales beat for a stock at a 3-year high valuation just isn't going to cut it.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/24/saupload_a1f658fee414133b774c503e20b1b49b.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">HAS data by YCharts</p> <p>This is especially true considering the valuation has boomed to a 3-year high while earnings growth expectations are roughly in-line with what they have been over the past 3 years. This created an unfavorable disconnect between valuation and growth. That disconnect (23x earnings for 12% growth) still exists, and we therefore still remain tethered by the valuation.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/24/saupload_78b7f86e27f10b5ac2cf870267e1b3c7.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">HAS PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts</p> <p>All in all, today's sell-off makes sense. You had a stock that had far too much baked into its valuation, and so it sold off when the numbers were just OK.</p> <p>But a deeper dig into the report implies that these OK<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> numbers will turn into GOOD numbers later this year. That means that despite the still rich valuation, HAS stock could head a lot higher by year-end.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The segment that really struggled in the quarter for HAS was the Partner Brands segment. Partner Brands revenue only rose 1%. That's troubling because this is the high-growth segment that features all the Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) toys. <span>It's been booming thanks to the strong pipeline of Disney movies that have been released recently, including Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers, the assortment of Princess movies, and many more.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But the weakness in the quarter can largely be attributed to seasonality with movie launches. This quarter, Partner Brands revenue was pushed higher by Spider Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. That was comping against the re-birth of Star Wars fanfare. <span>It's actually somewhat impressive that Partner Brands revenue rose in the quarter considering the tough comp.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Later this year, Hasbro's Partner Brands segment will have some huge movie launches coming against easier laps. The next big Star Wars movie is set to launch later this year. So is another Thor movie. Those catalysts will have easier laps, and so flattish Partner Brands growth should turn into strong Partner Brands growth later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That will likely drive revenue and earnings out-performance for HAS in 2H17. Considering the secular growth nature of the company given collateral benefits from Disney's strong content pipeline, such operational out-performance will drive the stock higher despite a rich valuation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We think today provides investors an interesting opportunity to start accumulating shares for a big 2H17 run.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro Deserves Your Attention. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4089914-hasbro-deserves-your-attention?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "73185", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "190184", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "86", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "170405", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4089914-hasbro-deserves-your-attention", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4089914-hasbro-deserves-your-attention", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/24/saupload_8bc06d490b466237d6d7190ac49065bd.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/24/saupload_8bc06d490b466237d6d7190ac49065bd.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "73185", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "l-f-capital-management", "userId": 29037705, "tagId": 170405, "bio": "<p>L&F Capital Management, LLC, is a quantitative investment management group located in San Diego, California.
