We believe that Hasbro is still the top play in the toy space and that company is entering the back half of a 'toy-cycle.' As the idea of the so-called 'toy-cycle' has been covered many times, we won't go into great detail, but we will say that this so-called cycle is where new products are released year-after-year piggybacking on successful movies, books, television shows etc. The current toy-cycle has benefited from the changing style of games/toys, moving away from hands on play to more digital/ interactive play.</p> <p>As the 'toy-cycle' has progressed, all major toy companies have been good stocks to own and trade over the last few years, however in the past few months Hasbro stock has entered full bear territory. We believe this major sell-off has brought the stock to an attractive entry point, and in this column, we will highlight a few key trends to support this long-term opinion.</p> <h3>Stock getting crushed</h3> <p>The stock is getting hammered as you can see:</p> <p>Figure 1. 5 Day Stock Price Chart Of Hasbro.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/23/3949741-1508773521604934_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"346\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/23/3949741-1508773521604934.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"168\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1508788800000&amp;chddm=1955&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ%3AHAS&amp;ntsp=0&amp;fct=big&amp;ei=QAfuWcnkKtaie6LSkIAF\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Finance</a></p> <p>The reason we are compelled to buy the stock here is that the long-term trend in fundamentals is positive, despite short-term pain in the stock price.
