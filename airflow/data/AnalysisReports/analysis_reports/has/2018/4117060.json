The stock has posted its largest correction since 2011 as a result of concerns about the toy market slowing and, more recently, there has been a lot of \"noise\" around the Toys R Us bankruptcy and the potential loss of revenue that this event may trigger for companies such as Hasbro and its competitors.</p> <p>Should Toys R Us go out of the business permanently, Hasbro would lose a retailer estimated to have an <a href=\"https://bizfluent.com/info-8479565-biggest-toy-retailers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">18% market share</a> in the toy retailing market in the United States and which accounts for only 9% of Hasbro\u2019s revenue. Anyway, it\u2019s important to notice that the company\u2019s distress was related to company-specific problems, not a general weakness in the toy industry. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that even in the case of Toys R Us going out of business, basically all the displaced market share will be recaptured by other retailers, both the traditional and digital ones, in a relatively short period.</p> <p>In any case, it\u2019s worth noticing that the correction started much before the rumors of a potential bankruptcy from Toy R Us started to spread. A deceleration in the industry is probably the main reason why the correction took place.</p> <p>While the company maintains an extremely solid competitive position in the industry, its revenue is very well diversified across geographies, brands, product lines, and segments. The company can count on both a wide range of owned brands and many non-owned partner brands. The franchise brands include the following:</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/26/44583886-15090308905802636_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"175\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/26/44583886-15090308905802636.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"130\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"130\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>Source: Hasbro's Annual Report</em></p> <p>Moreover, licensed brands include strong names such as Disney Princess And Disney Frozen, Star Wars, Marvel, Dreamworks\u2019 Trolls, Sesame Street, Beyblade and several others.</p> <p>Only 20% of the company\u2019s products are consumed by people above 14 years of age, but this share</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro - We Can Keep It Very Simple. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4117060-hasbro-can-keep-simple?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "101431", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "567626", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4117060-hasbro-can-keep-simple", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4117060-hasbro-can-keep-simple", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/26/44583886-15090306759486237_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/26/44583886-15090306759486237_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "1155", "type": "authorResearch", "attributes": {"createdAt": "2017-05-22T13:54:09-04:00", "title": "Ultimate Alpha", "rating": "5.0", "reviewCount": 1, "shortPitch": "High-quality research on long and short ideas in consumer industries.", "categories": [], "serviceAssistantIds": [], "inAppPurchasesAllowedInIos": false, "inAppPurchasesAllowedInAndroid": false, "activeSubscriptionsCount": 1, "androidIapPlan": "none", "iosIapPlan": "none", "description": "Consumer Alpha is an exclusive service for investors who want to have access to well-researched and actionable insights on consumer-related stocks, with an exclusive focus on the most compelling opportunities we can find in our daily research activity.
