Investing $1,000 in Apple (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a></span>) 10 years ago would have given you about 3.5 shares (before the split). Today, your 3.5 shares would be split in 25 shares and would be worth $4,250. This is enough to buy a new iPhoneX and keep shopping for a while.</p> <p>Apple is the future of dividend growth stocks. A company based on a solid business model offering several growth vectors. Investors can count on multiple dividend increases in the upcoming years and can also expect stock growth potential.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId5.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId5_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Source: Ycharts</p> <p>While many focus on AAPL's smartphone business, I would rather see the company's other sources of growth.

As APPL built a strong product ecosystem, it has the capacity of multiplying its revenue streams by simply adding services<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> between 2 products. Apple Pay, iTunes, Apple Music, and app stores are just the beginning. With total sales of nearly $30 billion in 2017, this is a complete business by itself. Your $1,000 invested in Apple instead of its iPhone will certainly pay more dividends in the future.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>$1,000 worth of toys for your kids</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toys? Who buys toys these days? Toys\"R\"Us is collapsing and Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) reported catastrophic earnings with sales down by 15%. However, there is a star shining among this \"dying business.\" While many think kids only want to play on their Xbox (then buy Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)!), Hasbro (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a></span>) has found a niche for itself. The company has developed a few icon brand names such as Transformers, Nerf and Play-Doh, but Hasbro's real talent lies in licensing others' toys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro has now 2 impressive partners named Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and Activision Blizzard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATVI\">ATVI</a>). The first one enabled Hasbro to pursue consistent growth through Disney Princess, Marvel SuperHeroes and Star Wars figurines. The latter kept Hasbro in the loop with a direct connection with video games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId10.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId10_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is also a strong dividend growth company that is now part of the Dividend Achievers. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully <em>increased their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years</em>. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics <a href=\"https://www.thedividendguyblog.com/2017/06/22/dividend-achievers-list-dividend-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While Mattel got hurt by Toys\"R\"Us' financial problems, HAS management isn't worried. After all, Toys\"R\"Us only counts for 9% of Hasbro revenue and it will certainly find other avenues to sell its toys. On the other side, it is giving the opportunity for Hasbro to consider the purchase of Mattel. At this point we are talking about rumors, but that would create a giant in the industry with great synergy potential. In the meantime, Hasbro will benefit from a strong holiday season with \"Thor: Ragnarok\" figurines and \"Star Wars - The Last Jedi\" coming in December. A $1,000 invested in this toy maker will pay for several Christmas to come!</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>$1,000 for a high quality dishwasher</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For my final Black Friday deal, I would like to suggest investing in dishwasher or plumbing equipment. If you want to benefit from the growing U.S. economy, there is one retailer that will make it happen and it's Home Depot (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD\" title=\"The Home Depot, Inc.\">HD</a></span>). Last week, HD reported another strong quarter with impressive comps sales and earnings growth:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId13.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"110\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/Q3%202017_Earnings_Infographic_LINKS.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">HD Q3 2017 infographic</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While investors are afraid Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) will smash the retail business with a double-bitted axe, Home Depot shows a semi-Amazon-proof business model. First, the quality of its customer services (through giving in-store advice and offering renovation support to its clients) will retain clients for a while. After all, if you are about to renovate your bathroom and put $10,000 in it, you surely want to get a few pieces of advice before you start. Second, Home Depot focuses on growing its larger items sales. While Amazon is able to ship a dishwasher, the size and weight make it harder and less profitable for it to hit this playground. Appliances, flooring, carpet, and pro-heavy equipment are leaders in HD stores for sales growth. Not to mention that HD has a well-built online store showing steady growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId15.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/106145_15112838741193_rId15_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Ycharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, Home Depot shows a strong dividend growth profile with 8 consecutive years with a dividend increase. Its annualized growth rate over the past 5 years is at 25%. This means the company doubles its payment every 3 years or so (its quarterly dividend payment was of $0.225 in 2009 and it is now $0.89). Then again, $1,000 invested in HD will grow fast and generate some decent quarterly checks rapidly.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Final Thought</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the market keeps riding this indefinite bull market and many are afraid to lose their shirt when the last song ends, I think there are still strong companies you can buy and hold for years to come. Apple, Hasbro, and Home Depot share several things in common. They are leaders in their industry. They benefit from a strong business model generating healthy cash flow. They share a generous dividend growth policy. So far, HAS is the only Achievers of this short list, but I have no doubt both AAPL and HD will achieve this milestone in a few years. Stop wasting your money on Black Friday and invest in robust dividend growth stocks instead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Seriously, if you made it this far, it's because you liked what you read.
