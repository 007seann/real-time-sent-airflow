Intrigued by the possibility of the house of Barbies joining hands with the army of G.I. Joes, I embarked on a research into the probably of the deal actually happening. Interestingly, the last I heard about the two companies in the same <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/09/toy-companies-hasbro-and-mattel-will-go-to-war-in-a-new-amazon-show/\" rel=\"nofollow\">headline</a> was September last year, when the marketing for a new Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) show titled <em>Toy Wars</em> on the behind-the-scenes rivalry between the two companies made the rounds. Little did I expect then that wedding bells could actually be ringing. A merger between the two would result in a combined company with a toy portfolio for both genders, bringing together \"Mattel's strength in the girls category and Hasbro's dominance over the boys' toy aisle\", as a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-04/hasbro-mattel-said-to-have-held-talks-about-possible-merger-ik8jsx1q\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> article aptly describes. In addition, the combined company would be better equipped to meet the challenge from their next largest rival, Denmark's Lego.</p> <p><strong>Speculation of a Merger between the Two Is Not New</strong></p> <p>As some of you <span>who have been following one or both of the toy companies would know, rumors about a potential merger between the two are not something new. Nevertheless, I was surprised after stumbling on a <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barbie-dolls-maker-mattel-reportedly-merger-talks-rival-hasbro-1542086\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> that stated the first such merger talks happened in 1996. At that time, the deal was eventually called off after Mattel initiated the withdrawal, with John Amerman, the then chief executive at Mattel blaming Alan Hassenfeld, then chairman at Hasbro for making the transaction complicated through political maneuvers and its comments via the media. Sounds like what someone would blame President Trump for when he tweets prematurely while deal negotiations are still ongoing.</span></p> <p>The most recent occurrence of such speculations happened almost exactly a year ago, where on February<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 5, 2016, Bloomberg broke the </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-04/hasbro-mattel-said-to-have-held-talks-about-possible-merger-ik8jsx1q\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">news</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> that Hasbro and Mattel had on-and-off talks regarding a merger. At that time, Hasbro was already trading at double the share price of Mattel, when just two years before (see chart below), the share prices of the two companies were almost moving in lockstep. As the share price comparison only tells us one part of a company, the enterprise value comparison would be more representative. Enterprise value </span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">is the</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. Thus, while the share price and the number of outstanding shares would give us the market capitalization, we need to consider the other items to give us a fuller picture of what a company is actually worth. Hence, while in 2013 the share prices of both companies were similar, the enterprise value </span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">chart shows a vastly stronger Mattel in that period. Unfortunately for Mattel, its enterprise value tumbled thereafter in 2014 and stagnated in 2015 before recovering in 2016. However, despite its enterprise value regaining above that of Hasbro in 2016, after its recent price correction in contrast to the sharp upwards spike of Hasbro share price, Mattel's enterprise value fell back to $10.33 billion, or $2.31 billion below that of Hasbro. Mattel had plenty of opportunities to negotiate a potential merger from a position of strength, at least on the enterprise value basis, but it has squandered it all. Journalists <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/02/04/mattel-hasbro-merger-talks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">used to</a> call Mattel the larger toy company among the two when talking about both in the same article, but now, at best for Mattel, we would see the merger of Mattel and Hasbro being written as a marriage of <em>equals</em>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/10/saupload_deec88f069c3fc65dc6b39d62c4f1621.png\" alt=\"HAS Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"yc_font paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS data by YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/10/saupload_6bb2c44e5a82d84732f1d5b319e86bd1.png\" alt=\"HAS Enterprise Value Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"yc_font paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS Enterprise Value data by YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Who's the Better of the Two?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With companies as large as Hasbro and Mattel, it is difficult to do an apple-to-apple comparison. I could do a very deep-dive SWOT analysis for each of the two companies. However, that might not be a very efficient use of time. Nevertheless, I fall back on two of my preferred metrics - Free Cash Flow and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). From the Free Cash Flow (Annual Year-on-Year Growth) chart, you would notice that the two companies have contrasting fates almost every year. One is never consistently outperforming the other in terms of this metric, though in 2016, Hasbro has proved to be the better one with a 51.1% annual y-o-y growth compared to Mattel at 22.8%. As for ROIC, Mattel was the clear winner from 2010-2013, but in 2014, its ROIC declined dramatically from 19% to below 7% by 2015. Currently, its ROIC at 6.81% pales in comparison with Hasbro which achieved 16.4% ROIC. It is worth noting that in the same period that Mattel's ROIC deteriorated, Hasbro improved on its ROIC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/10/saupload_530452cec59338bb358b16e65b213213.png\" alt=\"HAS Free Cash Flow (Annual YoY Growth) Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"yc_font paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS Free Cash Flow (Annual YoY Growth) data by YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/10/saupload_1cc1b5adf05b9858f2018a2ffec33467.png\" alt=\"HAS Return on Invested Capital (&lt;a href=\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>What are the Obstacles?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In 2016 when the rumor of a merger surfaced, Gerrick Johnson, a BMO Capital Markets Corp. analyst <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2016/02/analysts_say_hasbro_and_mattel_merger_unlikely\" rel=\"nofollow\">proclaimed</a> that there was \"zero chance\" that Hasbro and Mattel would merge due to antitrust issues. His view might be regarded as extreme, but he was not alone in considering the possibility of regulators deeming the combined company as second-to-none in the United States. Even from a global angle, Denmark's Lego A/S <a href=\"https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/us-hasbro-and-mattel-talk-merger-and-likely-to-face-antitrust-hurdles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">would be left</a> as their next, and only, comparable competitor. Despite that, some analysts in 2016 dismissed the idea that the merger would collapse solely based on the antitrust angle, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/15/hasbro-and-mattel-merger-talks-not-a-rumor-but-not.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">arguing</a> that the toy industry was so fragmented that a combined Hasbro-Mattel company would \"only account for a 20% to 25% share of the market\". A Seeking Alpha commentary <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3241148-toy-story-mattel-plus-3-percent-hasbro-all-time-high\">suggested</a> that the merger would have an easier hurdle to pass this time round.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Besides the regulators, Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) would be concerned about the bargaining power it would lose when Hasbro and Mattel merge. As recently as late 2015, Disney <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-disney-princess-hasbro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its switch from Mattel to Hasbro for the manufacturing of its Disney Princess dolls. Although in this episode, costs or profit margin was not the factor, it does highlight that big toy licensors would be left facing a very dominant Hasbro-Mattel when finding a toy partner for their merchandise. Hence, Disney, among others, might lobby hard for the merger to be terminated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With the evolving entertainment landscape and advancement in technology, I believe that a merged Hasbro-Mattel would not be as powerful a toy company as it is once thought. There are now much more entertainment options for the children, besides toys, such as mobile gaming consoles, games loaded on tablets and mobile phones, as well as plenty of video content on easily accessible YouTube. There is also a <a href=\"https://3dprint.com/159917/reddit-3d-printing-scavenger-hunt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trend</a> to 3-D print your own toys. For those who might not be as adventurous, there are many start-ups which have <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/01/toys-to-life-innovation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sprung</a> up to provide customized 3-D printed toys. Regulators and anyone opposing the deal would have to factor in the competition with the entire spectrum of options that kids nowadays have in entertaining themselves, rather than just against other toy companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With rising competition from non-traditional toys, Hasbro and Mattel will face increasing challenges to grow. President Trump's trade rhetoric could also result in higher costs of toy manufacturing for the two companies. A merger would result in a stronger company, better equipped to face its next global competitor, Denmark's Lego, in an affirmation of President Trump's America First policy. Regulators should be kinder to them this time round, should the merger indeed proceed to that stage, given that the competition landscape is now not isolated to among toy companies, but the wide options that kids have these days in entertaining themselves.</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS $MAT - Hasbro-Mattel Merger Speculation: Will Barbie Say Yes To G.I.
