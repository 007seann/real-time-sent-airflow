One of the largest companies in the toy industry is looking to acquire major competitor Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), according to a report from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hasbro-makes-takeover-approach-to-mattel-1510351281\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Mattel reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mattel-m-a-hasbro-exclusive/exclusive-mattel-snubs-hasbros-latest-acquisition-approach-sources-idUSKBN1DF32W?il=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">rejected Hasbro\u2019s first offer</a>, but we could still see more effort to make a deal happen.</p> <p>This is not the first time Hasbro and Mattel have considered a combination. The two sides have failed to come to terms in the past, but conditions today make a deal more appealing than ever. The toy industry has been thrown into a state of uncertainty over the past few years for a number of reasons, including:</p> <ul> <li>The precipitous decline in revenue and profitability for Mattel.</li> <li>Increased competition from a number of different sides.</li> <li>Shifting trends among distribution partners.</li> </ul> <p>A Hasbro/Mattel merger could address some of these concerns and create significant profit growth opportunities through cross-licensing, increased bargaining power, and cost control. Hasbro already has a place on our Focus List of high-conviction long ideas, and a successful merger with Mattel could make it an even better buy \u2013 assuming the price does not go to high.</p> <h3><strong>Good Time to Buy Low on Mattel</strong></h3> <p>Historically, Hasbro and Mattel have gone toe-to-toe for the status as America\u2019s most profitable toymaker. As Figure 1 shows, this pattern shifted in 2014. Mattel\u2019s return on invested capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018641-roic-definition-and-formulae-for-return-on-invested-capital\">ROIC</a>) took a sharp fall and has continued its decline.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1: HAS vs. MAT ROIC Since 1998</strong></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/28/753641-15118790741934037.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"255\" data-width=\"630\" data-height=\"255\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.</p> <p>Over the past year, Hasbro also surpassed Mattel in terms of annual revenue. Key Mattel brands such as Barbie, Fisher-Price, and American Girl have experienced revenue declines ranging from 6% to 30%. At the same time, Hasbro continues to grow revenue in the mid-to-high single digits.</p> <p>This divergence creates an opportunity<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> for an acquisition at an attractive price point as Mattel\u2019s stock price (down 59% since 2014) has followed its ROIC down. In the past, both Hasbro and Mattel have resisted acquisition offers at low ebbs in their profitability as they bet on cyclical trends lifting their performance. After three years of underperformance during an upswing for the industry, Mattel may no longer have the confidence in its ability to turn things around.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Potential Value Remains High</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If Hasbro can acquire Mattel at a discount due to its current troubles and help regain its past profitability, this deal could create significant value. Any acquisition should be evaluated based on whether it can generate an ROIC above the acquirer\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018661-wacc-definition-and-formula-for-the-weighed-average-cost-of-capital\">WACC</a>), which stands at 5.5% for HAS. Figure 2 shows the price Hasbro could pay for Mattel and still create shareholder value for different profit (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1014071-nopat-definition-and-formulae-for-net-operating-profit-after-tax-and-nopat-margin\">NOPAT</a>) scenarios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 2: Implied Acquisition Prices for HAS to Achieve 5.5% ROIC</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/28/753641-15118791026565692.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"121\" data-width=\"630\" data-height=\"121\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At its current level of profitability, Mattel is not worth buying at any price. If Hasbro can increase Mattel\u2019s profits back to 2014 levels, it can afford to pay a slight premium for Mattel. Were sales to increase to Mattel\u2019s peak NOPAT from 2013, all of a sudden Hasbro could pay more than double the current share price and still create value for its shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Figure 2 shows that an acquisition of Mattel has its risks, but under the right circumstances, it could pay off in a big way for Hasbro. The fact that Hasbro links executive compensation to ROIC gives us more confidence that the company will only go through with this deal if management believes it can enhance shareholder value by earning an ROIC above its WACC on the acquisition.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Competitors on All Sides</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On top of the fundamental evaluation, there are a number of strategic concerns to consider with this deal. Hasbro and Mattel have both faced significant competition over the past several years from high tech gadgets as well as traditional competitors such as Lego.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Both companies have invested in digital efforts to combat these challenges, with Mattel going so far as to hire Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) veteran Margo Georgiadis as CEO. Hasbro has focused more on the branding side, with Hasbro Studios creating TV shows and movies to drive product awareness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">An acquisition could allow both companies to combine their strengths and stave off high-tech competitors while taking market share from Lego, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lego-results/lego-to-cut-1400-staff-as-decade-long-sales-boom-ends-idUSKCN1BG0WK\" rel=\"nofollow\">looks vulnerable for the first time in years</a>.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Combination Would Provide Leverage Over Distributors</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Distribution channels have been another big problem for Hasbro and Mattel recently. After several years of reducing their dependence on the big three of Wal-Mart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), and Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, both companies saw their customer concentration increase in the past few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 3: HAS and MAT Percent of Sales to Top 3 Customers</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/11/28/753641-1511879122189885.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"251\" data-width=\"630\" data-height=\"251\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This increased concentration leads to a decline in bargaining power and more risk when a key distributor faces financial trouble, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/business/dealbook/toys-r-us-bankruptcy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent bankruptcy of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us</a>. A combined Hasbro and Mattel would have more leverage in negotiations for better prices, more shelf space, and more favorable repayment terms from Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The combined company\u2019s scale and leverage could be valuable on the cost side as well. One of the triggers for Mattel\u2019s decline was its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-disney-princess-hasbro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">loss of the Disney Princess</a> license in a bidding war with Hasbro in 2015. If the two companies aren\u2019t bidding against one another, they could presumably attain these licenses at a cheaper cost. We\u2019re <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4125473-things-are-looking-up-for-disney\">bullish on Disney\u2019s</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) long-term prospects, so securing that partnership at a more reasonable cost creates value.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Growth Potential Is High</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We mentioned the potential value for Hasbro if it can restore Mattel to previous profit levels. However, the potential synergies of this acquisition make the upside even higher. In many ways, the two companies have complementary strengths. Hasbro\u2019s valuable licenses could generate even more profits out of Mattel\u2019s iconic brands. Mattel\u2019s digital and internet-connected technologies could improve Hasbro\u2019s successful toys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the cost side, the two companies would have significant redundancies that could be eliminated to cut overhead. Mattel already has made cost cutting a priority, and this deal could accelerate that process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We don\u2019t normally love big acquisitions, but Mattel\u2019s cheap price, Hasbro\u2019s excellent corporate governance, strategic advantages, and significant potential synergies make this deal a potential winner.</p> <p
