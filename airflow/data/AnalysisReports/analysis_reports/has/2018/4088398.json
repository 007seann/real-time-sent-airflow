Hasbro\u2019s $757 million in FCF over the last twelve months equates to a 5% <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1981752-free-cash-flow-fcf-and-fcf-yield\">FCF yield</a>. Hasbro has also exhibited good stewardship of capital and has earned a double digit return on invested capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018641-roic-definition-and-formulae-for-return-on-invested-capital\">ROIC</a>) every year for the past decade. HAS currently earns a 17% ROIC, which is in the top-quintile of our coverage universe.</p> <h3><strong>Executive Compensation Plan Is Directly Aligned With Creating Shareholder </strong></h3> <p>Hasbro\u2019s executive compensation plan includes base salary, annual incentives, and long-term stock based compensation. One-third of performance share awards, which make up 50% of long-term incentive compensation, are tied to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/46080/000119312517109540/d317230ddef14a.htm#tx317230_19\" rel=\"nofollow\">average return on invested capital over a three-year period</a>. ROIC was added to Hasbro\u2019s executive compensation plan in 2015 based on shareholder feedback.</p> <p>The new focus on ROIC helps ensure executives continue to be good stewards of capital. Per Figure 2, Hasbro\u2019s ROIC has improved from 4% in 2001 to 17% TTM. In addition, Hasbro has grown <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/863661-economic-versus-accounting-earnings\">economic earnings</a> from -$102 million in 2001 to $438<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> million TTM.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 2: Hasbro\u2019s Exec Comp Plan Drives Rising ROIC</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003847928103964_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1041\" data-height=\"433\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003847928103964.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"266\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We know from Figure 3 below, and numerous case studies, that ROIC is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/4837046-roic-paradigm-for-linking-corporate-performance-to-valuation\">directly correlated to changes in shareholder value</a>. HAS\u2019 use of ROIC to measure performance ensures executives\u2019 interests are aligned with shareholders\u2019 interests.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Improving ROIC Correlated with Creating Shareholder Value</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Per Figure 3, ROIC explains 86% of the changes in valuation for the 19 Leisure Product peers under coverage. Despite HAS\u2019 17% ROIC, above the 12% average of the peer group, the firm\u2019s stock trades at a discount to peers as shown by its position below the trend line in Figure 3. If the stock were to trade at parity with its peers, it would be $123/share \u2013 9% above the current stock price. Given the firm\u2019s rising ROIC, shareholder-aligned exec comp plan, and consistent profit growth, one would think the stock would garner a premium valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 3: ROIC Explains 86% Of Valuation for Leisure Product Firms</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-1500384803359751_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1041\" data-height=\"516\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-1500384803359751.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Hasbro\u2019s Profitability Helps Build Market Leading Position</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a leader in the toy and game market, Hasbro\u2019s biggest competition comes from Mattel Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>), the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels. Per Figure 4, Hasbro\u2019s NOPAT margin and ROIC rank well above Mattel and near the top of peers such as JAKKS Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAKK\" title=\"JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\">JAKK</a>) and leisure product firms Escalade (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESCA\" title=\"Escalade, Incorporated\">ESCA</a>) and Callaway Golf (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MODG\">ELY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro\u2019s licensing model, which includes deals with Walt Disney Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and DreamWorks, and its in-house brands, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, and Play-Doh among others, provide many profitable business lines. High margins have allowed HAS to invest profits into developing new products, such as new NERF toys or even short video series\u2019 that tie into its existing brand names. At the same time, Hasbro is able to withstand pricing pressures from Mattel and other game makers, or look to lower its own prices in an effort to gain market share. Most importantly, high margins allow Hasbro to bid competitively for lucrative licensing deals, such as the current deal with Disney running through 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 4: Hasbro\u2019s Profitability Ranks Highly Among Peers</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003848140918896_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"250\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003848140918896.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"164\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Bear Concerns Focus on Diminished Toy Sales At Home &amp; Abroad </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a macro level, the U.S. economy is steadily improving. Wages are slowly rising, unemployment remains low, and consumer spending is growing. Each of these macro trends creates a positive business environment for Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a more micro level, Hasbro\u2019s operations are heavily tied to the growth of the overall toy industry. While bears may argue that Hasbro\u2019s success is simply a result of recent movie releases that can\u2019t be replicated in the future, its long history of profit growth suggests otherwise. Additionally, the toy industry, both in the U.S. and across the globe, has achieved consistent growth in recent years. Key categories for Hasbro have also grown well above industry averages, which also bodes well for the firm\u2019s future profit potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Global toy sales have grown 4% compounded annually over the past three years, surpassing a record $90 billion in 2016. Hasbro generated 44% of its revenues from its International segment in 2016 and was able to grow sales 11% year-over-year, well above industry average. According to NPD Group, a significant portion of global toy sales are driven by licensed toys, which makes Hasbro\u2019s licensing deal with Disney even more valuable on the global stage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Per Figure 5, U.S. toy industry sales have grown from $18.2 billion in 2014 to $20.4 billion in 2016, or 6% compounded annually. U.S. &amp; Canada sales represented 51% of Hasbro\u2019s revenue in 2016. More importantly, the Games/Puzzles and Dolls segments have grown well above industry average over the past three years. Games/Puzzles grew 16% compounded annually since 2014 while Dolls grew 10% compounded annually. These segments are key to Hasbro, with Games and Girls (which includes Hasbro\u2019s doll lineup) segments representing 28% and 24% of 2016 revenue respectively. Ultimately, over half of Hasbro\u2019s revenues are in the fastest growing segments in the toy industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 5: Toy Industry\u2019s Continued Growth Since 2014</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003848226824317_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1041\" data-height=\"435\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/7/18/753641-15003848226824317.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Sources: New Constructs, LLC</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bears may raise concerns about Hasbro\u2019s customer concentration. In 2016, Wal-Mart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>) accounted for 18%, 9%, and 9% of revenue respectively. Such concentration would be more concerning if it were based on one individual product at one specific store. At the same time, the reality is that the distribution of toys is heavily concentrated through those channels. Nevertheless, Hasbro\u2019s offerings are spread across numerous products, each reliant upon its own brand success and less upon the success of a specific retailer. On the other hand, customer concentration can also provide cost benefits, such as distribution efficiency or lower cost of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lastly, HAS\u2019 low valuation undermines many bear arguments. Despite improving profitability, upcoming product releases (detailed below) and strong economic trends, HAS\u2019 current valuation implies meager profit growth, as we\u2019ll show below.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Despite Price Increase, HAS Remains Undervalued</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS is up 45% year to date while the S&amp;P is up 10%. Since our <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/hot-stock-commentary-hasbro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">initial feature on Hasbro in January 2015</a>, the stock is up 116% while the S&amp;P is up 21%. Despite the rising share price, HAS still presents quality upside potential and remains undervalued. At its current price of $113/share, HAS has a price-to-economic book value (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/942151-definition-price-to-ebv-or-price-to-economic-book-value-ratio\">PEBV</a>) ratio of 1.2. This ratio means the market expects Hasbro\u2019s NOPAT to grow by only 20% over the remainder of its corporate life. This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 9% compounded annually over the past decade and 7% compounded annually since 1998.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If HAS can maintain TTM NOPAT margins (12%) and <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NewConstructs_DCF_HASvaluation_2017-06-05.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">grow NOPAT by just 5% compounded annually for the next decade</a>, the stock is worth $133/share today \u2013 18% upside. This scenario assumes HAS can grow revenue by consensus estimates in 2017 (8%) and 2018 (3%), and 5% each year thereafter, which equals the compound annual revenue growth rate over the past 10 years. With new film releases spurring toy demand, a growing overall toy market, and new product releases, HAS could easily meet or surpass these expectations. Add in the potential 3% yield detailed below, and it\u2019s clear why HAS could be a great portfolio addition.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Buybacks Plus Dividend Could Yield Over 3%</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro repurchased $151 million and $85 million of its stock in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Through April 2017, the company repurchased $18 million and had nearly $310 million remaining under its current authorization. Going forward, if HAS were to average the last two years repurchase activity ($118 million per year), the firm\u2019s existing authorization would last just under three years. A repurchase of this size is 1% of the current market cap. When combined, Hasbro\u2019s 1% repurchase yield and 2.2% dividend yield offer investors a total potential yield of over 3%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>New Products and Releases Could Spur Earnings Surprise</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro is able to tap into the enormous popularity of blockbuster film franchises by combining in-house brands such as Transformers, with licensed products such as Disney Princesses, Star Wars, and Marvel. These franchises spur demand without requiring heavy capital investment to create original content. New products, such as action figures, released alongside these films provide a significant revenue and profit growth opportunity for Hasbro. The film lineup through 2017 looks promising as well:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Beauty and the Beast \u2013 March 17</li> <li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \u2013 May 5</li> <li>Transformers: The Last Knight \u2013 June 21</li> <li>Spider-Man: Homecoming \u2013 July 7</li> <li>My Little Pony: The Movie \u2013 October 6</li> <li>Thor: Ragnarok \u2013 November 3</li> <li>Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 December 15</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Best of all, these movie properties are being expanded with multiple future releases already in the works. For instance, Michael Bay, director of the Transformers movies, noted in early May that there have been <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-transformers-movies-1491418003-htmlstory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">14 separate stories</a> written for potential movies. An additional Star Wars movie is planned for a 2019 release, along with spin-off stories on Han Solo and possibly Bobba Fett in 2018 and 2020. According to NPD Group, Star Wars was the top toy property in the world based on dollar sales in 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Best of all, Hasbro\u2019s growth opportunities expand far beyond Transformers and Disney. The company is introducing new NERF products, expanding its Magic: The Gathering lineup, and even developing digital products through its ownership of mobile game developer Backflip Studios. Additionally, Hasbro continues investing in top brands such as Monopoly and Play-Doh.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS is well positioned to capitalize on the growth of the toy market and do so profitably, with its leading margins per Figure 4 above. Beating both top and bottom line expectations, as it has done for six consecutive quarters, should prove an effective catalyst to send shares higher. When HAS beat both top and bottom line expectations in 4Q16, the stock rose 18% over the following week. When Hasbro surpassed expectations again in 1Q17, the stock rose 6% the following day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS could be poised for another beat and subsequent increase in valuation. In the meantime, investors in this stock carry very low valuation risk and are rewarded with a potential 3% total yield given HAS\u2019 history of dividends and share repurchases.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Insider Trends and Short Interest Are Minimal </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past 12 months, there have been 269 thousand insider shares purchased and 165 thousand insider shares sold for a net effect of 103 thousand insider shares purchased. These purchases represent less than 1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, short interest sits at 5.2 million shares, or 4% of shares outstanding.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Hasbro\u2019s 2016 10-K:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Income Statement: we made $258 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $80 million in non-operating expense (2% of revenue). We removed $89 million in non-operating income and $169 million in non-operating expenses. You can see all the adjustments made to HAS\u2019s income statement <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NewConstructs_Models_HAS_IncomeStatementAdjustments_2017-06-05.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Balance Sheet: we made $3 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $355 million. The largest adjustment was $481 million due to asset write-downs. This adjustment represented 14% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to HAS\u2019s balance sheet <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NewConstructs_Models_HAS_BalanceSheetAdjustments_2017-06-05.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation: we made $2.9 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $752 million. Apart from total debt, which includes $132 million in operating leases, the largest adjustment was $1.2 billion in excess cash. This cash adjustment represents 9% of HAS\u2019s market cap.
