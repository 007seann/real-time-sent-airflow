(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS\" title=\"Hasbro, Inc.\">HAS</a>), global toy and game manufacturer, is the featured stock from October\u2019s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio. HAS was also featured as a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4088398-one-of-best-plays-in-todays-stock-market\">Long Idea in July 2017</a>. </p> <p>Over the past decade, HAS\u2019 revenue has grown by 5% compounded annually while after-tax profits (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1014071-nopat-definition-and-formulae-for-net-operating-profit-after-tax-and-nopat-margin\">NOPAT</a>) have grown by 9% compounded annually, per Figure 1. HAS\u2019s NOPAT margin has improved from 8% in 2006 to 12% over the last twelve months. Long-term, HAS has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 1998.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS\u2019 return on invested capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018641-roic-definition-and-formulae-for-return-on-invested-capital\">ROIC</a>) (17% TTM) ranks in the top-quintile of our coverage universe and has improved from 11% in 2006.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 1: HAS\u2019 NOPAT Growth Over Past Decade</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/31/753641-15094851801319385.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"260\" data-width=\"630\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\">Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings<strong><br> </strong></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Steady Dividend Growth Supported by FCF</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS has increased its regular dividend seven consecutive years and 13 times in the past 14 years. The current annualized dividend has grown from $1.44/share in 2012 to $2.28/share, or 10% compounded annually. Growing FCF has fueled dividend growth in the past, and we expect the same for the future. Over the past five years, HAS has generated cumulative FCF of $2.6 billion (20% of market cap) and paid out cumulative dividends of $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Companies with FCF well in excess of dividend payments provide higher quality dividend growth opportunities because we know the firm generates the cash to support the current dividend as well as a higher dividend. On the flip side, the dividend growth trajectory of a company where FCF falls short of the dividend payment over time cannot be trusted to grow or sustain its dividend because of inadequate free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Figure 2: HAS\u2019 Free Cash Flow vs. Regular Dividend Payments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/31/753641-15094851912365031.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"262\" data-width=\"630\" data-height=\"262\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>HAS Remains Undervalued </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past three months, HAS is down 9% while the S&amp;P is up 4%. This price decline gives HAS a more attractive risk/reward trade-off. At its current of $97/share, HAS has a price-to-economic book value (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/942151-definition-price-to-ebv-or-price-to-economic-book-value-ratio\">PEBV</a>) ratio of 1.1. This ratio means the market expects HAS\u2019 NOPAT to grow by no more than 10% over its remaining corporate life. This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 1998 and 9% compounded annually over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If HAS can maintain current NOPAT margins (12% TTM) and <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NewConstructs_DCF_HASvaluation_2017-10-30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">grow NOPAT by 5% compounded annually over the next decade</a>, the stock is worth $128/share today \u2013 a 32% upside. Add in Hasbro\u2019s 2.3% dividend yield and history of dividend growth, and it\u2019s clear why this stock is in October\u2019s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Auditable Impact of Footnotes &amp; Forensic Accounting Adjustments</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Hasbro\u2019s 2016 10-K:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Income Statement: we made $258 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $80 million in non-operating expense (2% of revenue). We removed $169 million related to non-operating expenses and $89 million related to non-operating income. See all adjustments made to HAS\u2019 income statement <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NewConstructs_Models_HAS_IncomeStatementAdjustments_2017-10-30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Balance Sheet: we made $3 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $355 million. The most notable adjustment was $481 million (14% of reported net assets) related to asset write-downs. See all adjustments to HAS\u2019 balance sheet <a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NewConstructs_Models_HAS_BalanceSheetAdjustments_2017-10-30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation: we made $3.3 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $896 million. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $1.9 billion in total debt, which includes $132 million in off-balance sheet operating leases. This lease adjustment represents 1% of HAS\u2019 market value. Despite the decrease in shareholder value, HAS remains undervalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>This article originally published on </em><a href=\"https://www.newconstructs.com/featured-stocks-in-octobers-dividend-growth-model-portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>October 31, 2017</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.</em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Ernst &amp;
