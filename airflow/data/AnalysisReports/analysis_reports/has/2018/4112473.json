Most such companies will already be in the process of accruing the potential write down of receivables for months before the expense occurs in anticipation of the negotiated outcome. When it does happen it should not be a major issue for those toy manufacturers that maintain a strong balance sheet.</p> <p>It may be that there will be limits to how much credit companies are willing to extend TOY credit on future purchases. That could make stocking up for the holiday season more difficult for TOY this year. It could also negatively impact the bottom lines of toy manufacturers.</p> <p>This is just another step in the process of retail evolution and the need for toy manufacturers (as well as other consumer goods companies) to move more sales efforts online either directly to consumers or through intermediaries such as Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), <span>Wal-Mart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>) and others.

The big question will be which one will be able to do it right and<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> grow that side of its business. The other question is which of the two can build and maintain the strongest position the digital games world. The bankruptcy of TOY is just prologue to the greater revolution in the industry.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is when the quality of management becomes paramount to future success. Efficient capital allocation, great vision and excellent execution will define the winners. The words in annual reports and press releases by every company will always paint a great picture of the future. The reality is that those are only words unless management has established a track record of consistent achievement. That is why the past remains important. It tells us whether management can deliver on its promises or if the vision it espouses is just words. I prefer to look for consistent execution over promises.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Mattel by the numbers</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, now we will take a look at how each company has performed over the last ten years to get a sense of the quality of strategy and management. Those things may change but culture is much harder to transform and without adjusting the culture progress is difficult. All of the following charts below were created by Mark Bern, CFA using data from <a href=\"https://app.oldschoolvalue.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">oldschoolvalue.com</a>. I will not attempt to explain the trends as that become a task of subjective futility and does not add much more to the picture. It is the trend <span>itself that matters because it tells us how management has (and is) performing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId8.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"831\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId8_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The revenue trend followed the general improvements in the economy from the depths of the financial crisis bottom in 2009 but peaked in 2013 and has been in decline since. This is obviously not a healthy trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId9.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId9_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Earnings have taken a similar path but with the decline more severe. It is no surprise that the price of MAT stock has tumbled by 67% since the end of 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId10.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"830\" data-height=\"515\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId10_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"397\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dividend rose nicely as long as the company was growing but has flat lined since 2014. As we will see later in the side-by-side comparison the current yield is high but the dividend may be in jeopardy of a future cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId11.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"819\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId11_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"392\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">FCF (free cash flow) is the life blood of a company. How it is allocated by management determines future prospects for growth and underlying health. MAT management has maintained the dividend and share buyback program while the company has not generated enough cash to fund those actions. This would appear to be merely an attempted exercise in propping up the share price which has failed miserably.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId12.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"834\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId12_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since 2012, the company has used added debt to make up the shortfall and fund its decisions. This may not be sustainable over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId13.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"827\" data-height=\"511\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId13_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The amount of debt held by MAT is not the problem. Even the trend would not be a problem if the company were growing. But when revenue and earnings are falling and debt is rising the result is unlikely to be good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId14.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"422\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId14_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"324\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The trend in decreasing shares outstanding has ended out of necessity. I would be surprised if management attempted to continue the buyback program until the company can return to growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId15.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId15_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Acquisitions helped to fuel the growth in the past, but has not added needed growth since the last major acquisition in 2014. Where will the money come from to fund future growth? That is the question. I am not sure that management knows the answer either. Innovation would seem to be a promising route but it does not seem to the focus here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Hasbro by the numbers</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId16.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"831\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId16_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The trend has not been stellar in terms of revenue growth over the last decade but at least the company has held its own. The more recent trend since 2013 is encouraging, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId17.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"818\" data-height=\"461\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId17_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This looks like almost a mirror image of the same chart for MAT; earnings increasing in 2009 and falling into 2013, then rebounding and growing strongly since.

Overall, the total of dividends and buybacks is more than FCF, but at least there is more balance than we saw from MAT where FCF was higher only twice. It is not a perfect picture but much closer to what I would expect from a successful business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId20.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId20_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS management appears to use debt more sparingly than MAT, a good sign of more efficient asset allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId21.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"827\" data-height=\"511\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId21_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the two companies are roughly the same size (as measured by revenue) HAS has only about half as much total debt on its books. This is not a trend, per se, but it does give me the sense that HAS management is better at allocating capital and keeping its capital structure healthy. That allows management more flexibility for the future to invest in growth when opportunities arise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId22.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"422\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId22_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"324\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What I like about this chart is that management allocated a lot more toward buybacks when the stock price was much lower and represented a good value. Since the share price has risen management has tended to allocate much less toward buybacks. A well-managed company does not need to prop up its shares with buybacks. It consistently allocates capital to where the best return on investment is available. That appears to be what HAS has done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId23.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"833\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId23_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has not used acquisitions to fuel growth in recent years as management apparently has determined that assets available to be acquired have been too expensive. Instead it seems to have sold off assets that were not generating adequate FCF to justify retention, selling into the high valuation environment.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Side-by-side Comparison (growth rates over ten years)</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now we will take a look at the two companies using a few ratios that I prefer to consider when assessing the health of companies.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td></td> <td><p>MAT</p></td> <td><p>HAS</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Recent Stock Price</p></td> <td><p>$15.55</p></td> <td><p>$96.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>52-Week High/Low</p></td> <td><p>$33.23 / $14.35</p></td> <td><p>$116.20 / $76.14</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compound annual Revenue growth rate</p></td> <td><p>-1%</p></td> <td><p>3.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compound annual Earnings growth rate</p></td> <td><p>-6.8%</p></td> <td><p>5.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compound annual Dividend growth rate</p></td> <td><p>10.6%</p></td> <td><p>14.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compound annual FCF growth rate</p></td> <td><p>-2.4%</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Current Dividend Yield</p></td> <td><p>3.8%</p></td> <td><p>2.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Payout Ratio</p></td> <td><p>217.1%</p></td> <td><p>45.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Current P/E (trailing twelve months)</p></td> <td><p>22.3</p></td> <td><p>20.9</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Debt to Equity</p></td> <td><p>128%</p></td> <td><p>95%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Debt to Total Assets</p></td> <td><p>42.8%</p></td> <td><p>35.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Price to Sales</p></td> <td><p>1.0</p></td> <td><p>2.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Price to Book</p></td> <td><p>2.58</p></td> <td><p>6.7</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Price to FCF</p></td> <td><p>-388.9</p></td> <td><p>18.0</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash as a percent of Revenue</p></td> <td><p>5.2%</p></td> <td><p>27.9%</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The above table paints a very divergent picture between the two companies; one still on the rise, the other in decline. Both companies share prices suffered corrections since rumors about a possible TOY bankruptcy began, but HAS is off by far less (from its 52-week high) than MAT. I would expect this divergence to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While MAT ten-year growth rates of everything but the dividend have been negative, HAS has posted positive compounded annual growth rates over the same period. Even though, the dividend yield for MAT is higher it is primarily the result of a falling stock price, not very enticing in my opinion, and probably not sustainable unless FCF improves significantly going forward. The payout ratio for HAS is a healthy, but sustainable level. The opposite is true of MAT. I would not be surprised if MAT were to make the difficult decision of cutting its dividend to conserve cash. It may need to if debt becomes too expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From a valuation perspective, HAS appears to be cheaper but neither is what I could call a bargain with P/E ratios above 20. Obviously, HAS is the better value of the two but adding at this level may be more than my conservative approach can muster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Debt for both companies is higher than I would prefer but, here again, there is a divergence as HAS debt can is at a manageable level while MAT is too high and likely to continue to rise as long as it is able to borrow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If we were to look only at the Price to Sales or Price to Book ratios, one might surmise that MAT offered a better value. I would call this more of a value trap. Value investors may want to gamble on MAT being able to restructure the company and perform a turn around. But when I look at the next ratio, Price to FCF, the hairs on the back of my neck rise up. HAS has a reasonable Price/FCF ratio of 18 (we consider under 15 a bargain; see legend in the next section) while MAT is hugely negative. That one is an eye opener and should scare off any intelligent investors. It won't scare them all off, of course, but that is what makes up a market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">HAS has a healthy cash position; MAT not so much. One has cash the other needs it.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Friedrich algorithm data file assessments</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now I want to take a quick look at how the Friedrich algorithm scores each company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId24.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1716\" data-height=\"884\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/372226_15074944951326_rId24_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1098\">Friedrich Global Research</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Friedrich liked MAT in 2010 but flashed a warning in 2014 when FCF and revenue began to decline.

MAT stock price has fallen 28% while HAS stock is down nearly 17% since. If this represents an opportunity may be questionable (based upon valuations) but if investors are considering buying either one this is certainly a better time to enter than last June. Were I considering a purchase at this time it would have to be Hasbro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We hold HAS stock in our model portfolio, purchased on December 8, 2016, and intend to hold for the long term. That 2.4% dividend yield will help to ease any temporary pain.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comment section below and don't forget to hit the \"Follow\" button next to my name at the top of this article.

What we came up with is a final \"Main Street\" price per share based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which is a framework of accounting standards, rules and procedures defined by the professional accounting industry, which has been adopted by nearly all publicly traded U.S. companies. We feel that our Main Street price result is what each company would need to trade at in order to be attractive to a businessperson on Main Street looking to buy at a bargain. <br> <br> <br> Since the only constant in the universe is change, the results for each company fluctuate by varying degrees. No company is an island unto itself, but each operates in a world of constant change and at times in areas where Chaos is the norm. By analyzing a company\u2019s Main Street operations over time, Friedrich is able to give the potential investor a decade long analysis (opinion) as well as offering a Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) analysis (opinion), as well. Thus our readers will not only get as close to a real time view of operations on Main Street as is possible, but then can measure the consistency of the company\u2019s operations over time to determine if s/he should invest or not. <br> <br> <br> <br>Through our Friedrich algorithm we can analyze ten years of Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement data for each company all at once and generate one final result in seconds. Friedrich was designed to be ultra-conservative and thus will cut zero slack to any company under analysis and will do so with zero emotion. Companies must be exceptional in order to get an attractive Main Street valuation and the ideal investments according to our backtesting are the ones that have been consistent over time. <br> <br> <br> <br>By being so ultra conservative Friedrich is designed to identify bargains that Wall Street investors may have overlooked. Companies shares may trade on the stock market but the companies themselves operate on Main Street, so Friedrich is designed to generate a Main Street price per share first and only then does he go to Wall Street and see the price for which Benjamin Graham\u2019s \u201cMr. Market\u201d is offering the shares. <br> <br> <br>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/498/843/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/498/843/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/498/843/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/498/843/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Mycroft Friedrich", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2009, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2009, "followersCount": 13393}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "498843", "type": "user"}}, "authorResearch": {"data": {"id": "1098", "type": "authorResearch"}}}, "links": {"self": "/author/mycroft-friedrich", "profileUrl": "/author/mycroft-friedrich", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "has", "name": "HAS", "company": "Hasbro, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "25", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/HAS"}}, {"id": "1748", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "mat", "name": "MAT", "company": "Mattel, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/MAT"}}, {"id": "562", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "amzn", "name": "AMZN", "company": "Amazon.com, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NASDAQ", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/AMZN"}}, {"id": "62", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "tgt", "name": "TGT", "company": "Target Corporation", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/TGT"}}, {"id": "56", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "wmt", "name": "WMT", "company": "Walmart Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/WMT"}}, {"id": "13489", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "mark-bern-cfa", "name": "Mark Bern, CFA", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/mark-bern-cfa"}}, {"id": "14881", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "mycroft-friedrich", "name": "Mycroft Friedrich", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/mycroft-friedrich"}}, {"id": "35582", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "cfa-charter-holders", "name": "CFA charter-holders", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::SpecialType"}, "links": {"self": "/cfa/articles"}}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dividend-ideas", "name": "Dividend Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=dividend-ideas"}}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "consumer-goods", "name": "Consumer Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/consumer-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-income", "name": "Dividends & Income", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-income"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17860", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "toys-games", "name": "Toys & Games", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/toys-games"}}]}
