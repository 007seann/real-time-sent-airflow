Last month, I initiated a position in Hasbro on the previous pullback in stock price. At that time, the stock had already gone through a -20% decline, and in my opinion, the stock was trading at a discount to its fair value with reasonable upside. After re-evaluating investor concerns and the recent financial results, I still feel comfortable with my long position. I provide a brief overview of my takeaways from the financial results in the sections below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-15088323601395433.png\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"340\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>(Source: <a href=\"https://www.freestockcharts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FreeStockCharts</a>)</p> <p><span><strong>High Expectations for Fourth Quarter and Toy \u201cR\u201d US Bankruptcy</strong></span></p> <p>Management's updated guidance for fourth quarter results was the perceived cause of the current selloff for the stock, a decline of over 8%. The company otherwise had a solid third quarter, exceeding expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company's revenue and earnings per share were $1.79 billion and $2.09, respectively, in comparison to analyst consensus estimates of $1.78 billion and $1.94, respectively.</p> <p>The company is now expecting 4% to 7% revenue growth as opposed to expectations of 11.7% or $1.82 billion, currently reported by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst/HAS.O\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuters</a>. I made note of the high fourth quarter expectations in a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4109458-hasbro-on-sale-holiday-season\">previous article</a> when I first initiated a position, and was aware of the idea that the stock price could suffer slightly in the fourth quarter due to these expectations. The Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy was also another short-term concern to consider that had the potential to impact the company's bottom line in the next few quarters. These concerns<span>, </span>however, continue to be only short-term challenges, and I believe the company\u2019s long-term growth and financial health will not be<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> affected. As reported on Hasbro\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/3422778\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">10-K filing</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us accounted for 9% of Hasbro\u2019s total revenue, thus the bankruptcy will cause disruption to the company\u2019s supply chain. However, it is my belief that Hasbro just needs some time to figure things out, and supply the demand for its products through other retail or e-commerce channels -- time that the company should have based on the fact that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has obtained debt financing, and is working out agreements with Hasbro. </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3303161-hasbro-toys-r-us-still-business\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As reported</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, the company is still providing inventory to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, but assessing how much inventory to provide.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Per the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4115536-hasbros-ceo-brian-goldner-on-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript\">company's earnings call transcripts</a>, management indicated:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Yes, so clearly we are assessing what Toys \"R\" Us can receive, but our expanded retail channel strategy gives us great confidence that we can find home for our inventories, and given where our inventories are and that they\u2019re in great shape and that fact that POS is growing at double digits both globally as well as in the U.S.</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Evaluating Lower Operating Profit</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1044842\" rel=\"nofollow\">As reported</a>, and further discussed by management in the earnings call transcripts, although revenue was up for the third quarter, the company experience a decline in operating profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-15088332925125437.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"349\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4115397-hasbro-inc-2017-q3-results-earnings-call-slides\">Hasbro's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Slides</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management cited bad debt expense associated with the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy as the main driver for the decline in operating profit. Per Management on the earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Hasbro operating profit dollars were essentially flat and operating margin declined to 20.1% versus 21.6% in 2016. As mentioned, operating profit margin would have been approximately 100 basis points higher, excluding the bad debt expense.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In reviewing the company\u2019s statement of operations, we see that Selling, Distribution and Administration expense, which includes bad debt expense, has increased by 0.4% when compared to the same period last fiscal year. Also, cost of sales has increased by 1.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the earnings call, management addressed the increase in cost of sales, and confirmed its guidance given earlier in the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>But if you move up to margin, gross margin and you think about the guidance that we've been giving all year is that we did say we expected our gross margin and our cost of sales actually to be higher than a year-ago, because of the mix of product and also some less favorable hedges that we had in place and it's not that were not hedging.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-15088336792935984.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"522\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1044842\" rel=\"nofollow\">Company's Press Release - Financial Results</a>)</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Quantifying the Impact of Bad Debt Expense Associated with Toys \"R\" Us</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As previously stated, management stated that operating margin would be approximately 100 basis points higher, when excluding bad debt expense. This would indicate operating margin to increase from 20.1% to approximately 21.1%, before bad debt expense. I provide further context of the impact to the bottom line below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-15088339650569592.png\" data-width=\"394\" data-height=\"204\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: <a href=\"https://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1044842\" rel=\"nofollow\">Company's Press Release - Financial Results</a>, with Author's calculations)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Per the table above, an additional 1% of total revenue added to operating profit leads to an increase of about $13.6 million net of taxes, and about $0.11 to be added to earnings per share (diluted). With the exclusion of the bad debt expense impact, operating profit is higher from prior period last year, and operating margin is only slightly lower by 0.5%. I don't believe that operating profit should be much of a concern given these considerations.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Assessing Company's Growth</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro continues to show moderate to strong growth in its revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-1508834315439748.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"347\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Hasbro's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Slides)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As discussed in my previous article, the company\u2019s international segment growth was a ongoing concern for investors. Per the slide above, international growth for the nine month period in 2017 is 5% as opposed to 12% for the same period in 2016. However, the 12% growth in 2016 should be taken into context. When excluding foreign currency translation from the international segment for the nine month period ending for 2015, 2016, and 2017, I calculated the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/24/48740503-15088344598661163.png\" data-width=\"565\" data-height=\"167\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Company's 10-Q Filings and Earnings Slides, with Author's calculations)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thus, negative foreign currency translation has a significant impact on net revenue for the company's international segment in 2015. In turn, this skews growth comparisons year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In conclusion, Hasbro is facing short-term challenges associated with the bankruptcy of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and with fourth quarter expectations coming in a bit too high; however, in my opinion, Hasbro remains financially healthy and is exhibiting moderate to strong growth. As previously discussed above, after adjusting for bad debt expense associated with the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy, the company\u2019s operating margin is only slightly down from the same period last year. In addition, the company shows growth in its top line revenue, its Segments, and its Brands, with only a slight exception to a 2% decline in its Partner Brands. The international growth comparisons need to be taken into further context, as these have been skewed by a large negative foreign currency translation in 2015. From my perspective, the company is still in a good position to succeed, despite having a few \u201crough patches\u201d along the way. Looking forward, and reported by <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14354994/1/hold-on-to-hasbro-stock-will-make-bank-on-next-years-marvel-movies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheStreet</a>, Marvel is expected to release eight movies in 2018 which could serve as a future catalyst of growth for Hasbro. In addition, the company now has a 2.5% dividend yield and remains shareholder friendly with its stock buybacks. After evaluating the results, I continue to hold my long position and may consider adding to this position depending on how the stock price shakes out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As always, you should perform your own due diligence and evaluate your own portfolio and risk before initiating or selling a position in the stock mentioned.
