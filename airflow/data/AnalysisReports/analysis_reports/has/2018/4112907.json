Ratings are also down at the smaller Disney Jr. and Disney XD networks. These are the age groups that buy toys from Hasbro.</p> <p>There are a number of possible explanations for these developments. Streaming is often blamed as the main cause because younger audiences are shifting over to content that is accessible on their smartphones or tablets. However, they still go to big screen cinemas to see major blockbusters. In other words, streaming is one but not the only one reason for the decline in cable and cinema audiences</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another, more sophisticated, assessment was provided recently by my esteemed colleague Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital who said on September 6 that \u201cthe toy industry is suffering from a bad case of movie fatigue.\" In addition to lackluster performance at the box office, we blame an oversaturated movie market, fatigue in certain properties associated with multiple sequels, and competition from entertainment from other screens for underperformance of movie-related toys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The main reason for underperformance, in our view, is that there are too many movies being released and released too frequently. Aside from cannibalization, the rapid release of new movies makes each movie less relevant, less able to stand out amongst a crowded field, and limits general buzz.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I had said something similar, though less elegantly, in my article \u201cDisney - One Success Story, Several Societal Problems, A Couple Of Chinese Opportunities And One Major Blunder\u201d published on June 16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Garrick has definitely a point if one looks at the number of Action Figure movies released or to be released between 2014 and 2018:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688747024913_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"725\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688747024913.png\" width=\"464\" height=\"271\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"373\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Box Office Mojo</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Further supporting this contention is the fact that toy-related movies have taken a hit in terms of ticket sales. Comparing the most recent major toy-related films with their previous releases shows that ticket sales have plummeted by nearly one quarter:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076689251213272.png\" data-width=\"628\" data-height=\"277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now looking at the impact on Hasbro specifically, their all-important Action Figure program is basically driven by five properties \u2013 Star Wars, Spider-Man, Transformers, The Avengers and The Guardians. It hence is interesting to scrutinize their performance from three different vantage points \u2013 worldwide consumer interest, U.S. shelf space and worldwide toy sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Between December 2003 and September 2017, there were a total of 18 movie releases for the five properties \u2013 5 Transformers, 5 Spider-Man, 4 Star Wars, 2 Avengers and 2 Guardians. The only two movies that clearly stood out in terms of consumer interest were the 2005 Star Wars movie Revenge of the Sith and the 2015 Star Wars movie The Force Awakens. All others, including Star Wars Clone Wars and Star Wars Rogue, attracted minimal consumer interest if Google Trends is anything to go by:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076689545029223.png\" data-width=\"628\" data-height=\"336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">The shelf space allocated by leading U.S. retailers also suggests that the buyers were not particularly enthusiastic about these movie properties either. The chart below shows shelf space levels allocated to the action figure toys for the most recent release in comparison to the one allocated to its prequel as measured on the movie release date. Except for The Guardians, which was marginally up, all other four were down and the difference for all five combined was in the order of minus 31%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-1507668874885956_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"753\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-1507668874885956.png\" width=\"482\" height=\"289\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"383\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> Source: Klosters Retailer Panel</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Most relevant is the sales result of these movies on Hasbro\u2019s Action Figure program. The bars below represent worldwide Hasbro shipments in the four quarters of the movie release date:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688749451904_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"753\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688749451904.png\" width=\"482\" height=\"289\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"383\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Klosters Retailer Panel</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Again here, we see that the latest movie release of The Guardians did better than its prequel whereas all other movie properties were down. This, interestingly, exactly mirrors the shelf space performance as shown further above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toy sales of movie-driven action figures are further affected by the presence, or absence, of collectors. This group, mainly adults, represent a significant percentage of the consumer group buying these toys. In the specific case of Star Wars The Force Awakens collectors were estimated to have accounted for about 30% of all Action Figure sales. This plummeted to about 15% in the case of the sequel Rogue and now until end of September accounted for less than 5% for The Last Jedi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Similar declines are noted, albeit at a much lower base level, for the other four movie properties. Buyers believe that two factors are responsible for this development. One is the perception that sequel products are less attractive as collectibles and the other is the migration by the collectors from Hasbro\u2019s traditional action figures to Funko collectibles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If this trend continues, the negative effect on Hasbro\u2019s top line will be cumulative and the company will have to find new and different ways to invigorate its business in future. One way to do so is product innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Whilst the association with Disney has in many ways been a boon to Hasbro, it has also had one negative side effect \u2013 Hasbro began to rely to a major degree on Disney\u2019s movie IPs for its innovation program for Action Figures and Fashion Dolls. Given the vulnerability of cable and movie-driven IPs, the question is whether Hasbro is recognizing this and is taking corrective action.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To determine this, the managers of the Klosters Retailer Panel were in September asked to identify the 100 new products launched during the second half of this year most likely to significantly impact fourth quarter and next year\u2019s toy landscape. These products were ranked and each assigned a weight and this was the result as far as the individual companies were concerned:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076689823857632.png\" data-width=\"384\" data-height=\"321\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Klosters Retailer Panel</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Note, however, that these percentages do not represent shipments or sales in the fourth quarter but rather reflect the longer-term importance the retailers see in the selected new and innovative products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro emerged as the clear forerunner. This is how the company\u2019s individual category weights broke out:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-150766900756915.png\" data-width=\"508\" data-height=\"196\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Klosters Retailer Panel</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disney movie IPs accounted for all of the Action Figure weight whereas they represented 30% of the Doll category. They were no factors in any other category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This tells me that Hasbro continues to be extremely dependent on movie IPs for its longer-term Action Figure and Girls program. Both categories accounted for 45% of total sales last year and are expected to clock in at 46% this year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If the trends we have seen for cable and cinema audience numbers persist and continue to have an effect on toy sales, then Hasbro\u2019s business objectives will begin to diverge from those assumed by Disney. Hasbro will have little choice except to develop business opportunities outside the Disney orbit and Disney will resist this because this diversification is likely to come at its expense. As we have seen in the case of Mattel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAT\" title=\"Mattel, Inc.\">MAT</a>) \u2013 Barbie versus Disney Princess \u2013 Disney does not take kindly to situations where its interests are in direct conflict with those held by its partner.</p>", "twitContent": "$DIS $HAS - Disney Has Problems And Hasbro Is In A Box. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4112907-disney-problems-and-hasbro-is-in-box?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "48741", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "86", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "4040", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "102761", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4112907-disney-problems-and-hasbro-is-in-box", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4112907-disney-problems-and-hasbro-is-in-box", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688746026514_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/435974-15076688746026514_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "48741", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "lutz-muller", "userId": 435974, "tagId": 102761, "bio": "Lutz is an acknowledged expert on the toy space.
