Period. End of article. Followers of my work know I have described many times the phenomenon that occurs every now and again known as the 'toy-cycle.' As this has been covered many times, I won't go into great detail, but will say that this so-called cycle is where new products are released year-after-year piggybacking on successful movies or other entertainment related venues. We have been in a cycle for a few years. All major toy companies have been good stocks to own and trade over the last few years. We know toy companies have moved away from traditional toys and board games into more interactive products. The traditional toy industry is still kicking, but technology like electronic/computer-based toys, apps and complex interactive toys are now extremely popular. Hasbro is a stock I have called a winner.</p> <p>That said, what can we expect looking ahead? I think Hasbro is set to continue its slow run higher as its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3240666-hasbro-beats-0_37-beats-on-revenue\">most recent earnings report</a> was solid. The report reveals the consumer is strong, but there are of course threats to the company. With this the first major toy company reporting, the quarterly report provides a basis for where the sector may be heading. I of course have extremely high expectations as this is Q4, and is the blockbuster quarter in the toy space, for obvious reasons. To my surprise this quarter was actually much stronger than I expected, at least on the headline numbers. It delivered a strong top line and bottom line beat versus analyst estimates. Net revenues for Hasbro's Q4 2016 were 11% higher year-over-year. Revenues were $1.63 billion beating estimates by a strong $130 million.</p> <p>As I have already discussed in most articles this earnings season, the strong dollar has been</p>", "twitContent": "$HAS - Hasbro For The Win. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4043884-hasbro-for-win?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "We are Quad 7 Capital, a team made up of former asset management fund analysts.
