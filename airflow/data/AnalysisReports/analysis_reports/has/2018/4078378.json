Space Ape's revenue last year was $92 million and most of it from \"Earth Wars.\" \"Earth Wars'\" success helped persuade Supercell to buy a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/supercell-space-ape/\" rel=\"nofollow\">62% controlling interest</a> in Space Ape Games last month.</p> <p>Supercell is the developer behind the multibillion-dollar games, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3105566-softbank-supercell-could-be-worth-5-billion-to-11-billion\">Clash of Clans</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4010876-tencent-clash-royale-is-americas-top-grossing-iphone-game\">Clash Royale</a>.\" Supercell is now therefore a customer of Hasbro's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2993576-hasbros-fundamental-business-model-shift\">IP licensing</a> business. Landing Supercell as a licensing partner is beastly good for the long term.</p> <p>Supercell's not-so-secret success in mobile games is partly due to its massive <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/27/why-king-and-supercell-spent-nearly-500m-marketing-their-games-and-how-you-can-spend-way-less/\" rel=\"nofollow\">8-figure</a> annual advertising budget. Supercell also spent<a href=\"https://www.pocketgamer.biz/chart-of-the-week/62558/machine-zone-supercell-and-king-tv-ad-spend/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$59 million</a> on U.S. TV ads to promote \"Clash of Clans\" in 2015. My point now is that Supercell, as the parent firm of Space Ape Games, could also do a big-budget approach to help promote \"Transformers: Earth Wars.\"</p> <p>A viral digital and TV ad campaign is needed to attract more big-spending gamers to \"Transformers: Earth Wars.\" Supercell's savvy marketers could make \"Transformers: Earth Wars\" as successful as \"Clash of Clans.\"</p> <p><strong>Why Supercell Needs Transformers</strong></p> <p>Tencent (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>), the parent company of Supercell, needs another strong revenue generator from Supercell. Supercell only has two games (\"Clash of Clans\" and \"Clash Royale\") that are generating $1 billion or more in annual sales. Furthermore, \"Clash of Clans'\" daily revenue is no longer as lucrative as it was two year ago. Supercell used to generate <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/05/supercell-makes-5-million-per-day-off-clash-clans.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">daily sales of $5 million</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> from \"Clash of Clans.\" However, releasing \"Clash Royale\" last year </span><a href=\"https://clashtoday.com/2016/08/30/the-double-edged-sword-of-shared-ip-clash-of-clans-and-clash-royale-cannibalization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">cannibalized</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> a large number of \"Clash of Clans'\" big-spending players.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Tencent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-21/tencent-leads-8-6-billion-deal-for-clash-of-clans-game-studio\" rel=\"nofollow\">paid $8.6 billion</a> last year to take an 84% stake in Supercell. Tencent definitely wants Supercell to reduce its over reliance on \"Clash of Clans\" and \"Clash Royale.\" Buying Space Ape Games allows Supercell to diversify its portfolio. The Hasbro-licensed \"Transformers: Earth Wars\" offers Supercell a unique game to push on its millions of current customers. \"Earth Wars\" could appeal to RTS mobile gamers who want console-like graphics quality and more complex gameplay than \"Clash of Clans\" offers right now. \"Clash of Clans\" is a cartoonish, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/25d/3015-660/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.5D</a> top-down game. \"Earth Wars\" is a full 3D game - it offers rich visuals and special effects usually found only on console/PC games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A big budget marketing campaign from Supercell could make \"Transformer: Earth Wars\" a $25 million to $50 million monthly sales generator like the Disney-licensed \"Marvel: <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/20/marvel-contest-of-champions-publisher-kabam-will-sell-its-assets-to-south-korean-firm-netmarble/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contest of Champions</a>\" mobile game from Kabam. I am not privy to the financial details covering the IP licensing of \"Transformers.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I guesstimate that aside from an upfront payment, Hasbro likely gets 10-30% royalty fee on \"Transformers'\" net revenue. If this Supercell-owned mobile game gets net annual revenue of $500 million, Hasbro stands to earn royalty fees of more than $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Tencent Could Also License Hasbro IP for Its Own Chinese Mobile Games</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hasbro shareholders should also take into account that Tencent is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e79b1a78-3afd-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23\" rel=\"nofollow\">biggest</a> mobile games publisher in China. Tencent's mobile games accounts for most of China's top-grossing mobile games. It is realistic to expect Tencent to eventually buy a license to create Chinese versions of Hasbro-licensed video games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Tencent owns the biggest Android app store in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/6/19553521_14963662197398_rId24.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"920\" data-height=\"655\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/6/19553521_14963662197398_rId24_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"456\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><em>(Source: Newzoo)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Tencent has recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4077163-time-warner-licenses-dc-comics-superheroes-to-tencent\">licensed DC superheroes</a> from Time Warner (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWX\">TWX</a>) for its upcoming \"<a href=\"https://www.gamezebo.com/2017/05/12/strike-of-kings-moba-soft-launch-tencent/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strike of Kings</a>\" mobile MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game. Hasbro certainly has popular assets like Transformers, G.I. Joe, Monopoly, and My Little Pony, which are recognizable in China. Tencent could make a ton of money making Chinese mobile games from the G.I. Joe and Transformers universe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I like the business of the freemium mobile games. Selling virtual currencies and items for real dollars to mobile gamers is the best exercise of capitalism. Freemium games like \"Clash of Clans\" and \"Clash Royale: is why mobile gaming is now worth $46.1 billion/year. I am endorsing HAS as a buy. Hasbro has a solid portfolio of toy-related characters and superheroes that could be monetized best by Supercell and/or Tencent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/6/19553521_14963662197398_rId27.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"576\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/6/19553521_14963662197398_rId27_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>(Source: Newzoo)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I can tolerate Hasbro making mobile games. However, I prefer the easy money from licensing/royalty fees. Hasbro should focus more on making toys and merchandises for kids. Let other firms like Supercell and Tencent monetize Transformers and G.I. Joe on mobile games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">There are many technical traders here at Seeking Alpha, which is why I always back up my bull thesis articles with trade signals from technical indicators.
