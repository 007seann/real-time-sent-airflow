However, Hasbro\u2019s stock price was recently on the receiving end of perceived headwinds. An evaluation of Hasbro\u2019s financial health and performance through the company\u2019s revenue, operating income, and operating cash flows, suggests that the pullback in stock price is overdone. Further, a conservative valuation using the discounted cash flow model suggests that the stock has reasonable upside and may be moderately to significantly undervalued.</p> <h3><strong>Pullback in Stock Price</strong></h3> <p>Hasbro's stock price has shed as much as -20% in the past two months \u2013 a pullback from an all-time closing high of $115.95 to a recent closing low of $92.67 (-20%). In the recent weeks, major movement of the stock price has subsided and it has traded in the range of $93 \u2013 $96.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063143749743993_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1483\" data-height=\"580\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063143749743993.png\" width=\"625\" height=\"244\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"250\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>(Source: Yahoo Finance)</p> <p>The selling pressure on the stock price is most significantly attributed to (1) ambitious investor expectations and the recent stock\u2019s performance having gained 50% from January to July, and (2) Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019 recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</p> <h3><strong>Growth Concern</strong></h3> <p>The ambitious expectations from investors is a factor out of Hasbro\u2019s control which has negatively impacted the stock price. Despite Hasbro meeting revenue and exceeding earnings analyst consensus estimates, shareholders proceeded to sell and take profits, reading into the Hasbro\u2019s revenue as a precautionary sign of \u201ctrouble.\u201d</p> <p>One major area of concern has been the company\u2019s international segment growth. When comparing the current six month period to the same period in the prior year, U.S. and Canada segment revenue grew by 9% whereas International segment revenue grew by a<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> modest 3%. The annual growth in these two segments was 15% for U.S. and Canada and 11% for International from 2015 to 2016.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063149223885179.png\" data-width=\"604\" data-height=\"484\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Information derived from Company's 10-Q and 10-K Filings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, these growth rates must be taken into context when evaluating Hasbro because of the inherent seasonality of its business. A substantial portion of Hasbro\u2019s net revenue is earned during its third and fourth quarters leading up to holiday season. In 2016, Hasbro\u2019s third and fourth quarter revenues accounted for 33% and 32% of total revenue, respectively. More specifically, the third and fourth quarters, in total, account for 66% of revenue earned from the company\u2019s U.S. and Canada segment, as well as 66% of revenue earned from the company\u2019s International segment. As an investor, I am more concerned with results and growth in the second half of the year and believe the selloff to be overdone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-1506315026404673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"797\" data-height=\"374\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-1506315026404673.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"300\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Information derived from Company's 10-Q and 10-K Filings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It may also be noteworthy to mention that the company's management team has indicated in its recent 10-K filing that the international segment revenue included a negative impact caused by foreign currency translation of $58.4 million in 2016 as opposed to $379.4 million in 2015, which further impacts the growth rate comparison year-over-year. Putting all this into context, Hasbro still has time to improve its year-over-year growth rates into the company\u2019s most important time of the year - the holiday season. Regardless, it may be a stretch to assume that revenue growth rates will remain the same in 2017 from 2016, thus a more conservative estimate of growth has been utilized in the valuation detailed in the subsequent section of this article.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Bankruptcy</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us' bankruptcy filing is another factor that is out of Hasbro\u2019s control. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us' bankruptcy should have a minimal effect on Hasbro in the short-term during its most important time of the year. As previously reported on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/19/toymakers-shares-rebound-as-toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC</a>, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has obtained $3 billion in debt financing, and as previously reported on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2017/09/19/toys-r-us-mattel-hasbro-bankruptcy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortune</a>, the company intends to keep \"its shelves stocked through the holiday season,\" which should put vendors such as Hasbro at ease. In the short-term, Hasbro will not need to immediately find new retail channels for distribution of its products. According to the Hasbro\u2019s 2016 10-K filing, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us accounts for 9% of Hasbro's total revenue, alongside notable retailers of Wal-Mart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) 18% and Target Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>) 9%. In general, retailers have seen significant declines in market share in the recent year; however, Hasbro, as manufacturer, has shown a strong rally prior to the recent decline. Should Toys \u201cR\u201d Us completely cease to exist, it is my belief that Hasbro will simply supply the demand for its products through other retail or e-commerce channels.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Operating Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating income and operating cash flow continue to show consistent reasonable growth in line with its increases in revenue. In evaluating the financial health of a company, I tend to focus most closely on these two metrics, and line items which drive these metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063155613539333.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"217\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063155732633798.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"158\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Information Derived from Company's 10-K and 10-Q Filings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From my experience, net income is almost always adjusted for non-operating items in order to properly compare year-over-year. This makes operating income and operating cash flow which excludes non-operating and one-time adjustments a better indicator of financial performance. Hasbro has shown consistent increases in operating income and operating cash flow both annually and during the recent quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Obviously, past performance does not dictate future performance; however, it does showcase the long lasting strength of the company\u2019s brands and its ability to adapt to consumer changes. This is especially the case when compared to competitor Mattel which has seen its stock significantly underperformed and decline more than 47% since January.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Total revenue growth of 13% from 2016 to 2015 is unlikely sustainable in the long run. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst/HAS.O\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuters</a>, consensus estimates for revenue in the third and fourth quarter are $1.80 million and $1.82 million, respectively. These estimates indicate revenue growth of 6.9% and 11.7% from prior year\u2019s third and fourth quarter. In addition, the consensus estimate of total revenue for 2017 is $5.43 million; an annual growth of 8.2% for 2017 from 2016. In reviewing these estimates, there may be some short-term concern regarding the high fourth quarter revenue estimate. It is important to keep these growth estimates in mind when evaluating the current stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To evaluate the attractiveness of Hasbro\u2019s current stock price, I utilized the discounted cash flow model with a very conservative long-term growth rate of 3%. The risk free rate utilizes the yield on a 10 year government bond, and the discount rate utilizes the calculated weight cost of capital (WACC). The interest rate is based on the calculated weighted average interest rate of the company's long-term debt derived from the company\u2019s most recent 10-Q.<img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063157287024944.png\" data-width=\"552\" data-height=\"140\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063158216913493_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"691\" data-height=\"278\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-15063158216913493.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"257\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/26/48740503-1506405410885398_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"864\" data-height=\"147\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/26/48740503-1506405410885398.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"109\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>(Selected information has been derived from Company\u2019s 10-Q and 10-K with further assumptions and calculations made by the author)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even when using a very conservative long-term growth rate of 3% for the company\u2019s free cash flows, the intrinsic value of the stock is calculated at $94.56 in comparison to the stock's recent closing price of $96. This suggests that the stock is currently trading near the assumption that the company will grow at the same estimated rate of the global economy as a whole \u2013 a rate that some investors use as their perpetuity rate in a discounted cash flow model. This would not be a fair assessment of Hasbro given its recent growth in revenue, operating profit, and operating cash flow which were discussed in the previous sections of this article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, instead of relying on one set of assumptions, it is often helpful to create a valuation matrix based on a range of possible growth and discount rates. Dependent on the company, industry, and one\u2019s risk tolerance at the time, different rates may be deemed appropriate. Currently, the analyst consensus target price is $109.38 according to the <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/HAS/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-1506315995297888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"690\" data-height=\"174\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/9/25/48740503-1506315995297888.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"161\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Source: Author's calculations)</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In conclusion, Hasbro has remained relevant with its franchise brands, partnerships with box office names such as Disney and Marvel, and its expansion into entertainment and licensing which diversify its revenues into digital gaming, television and movie entertainment. There will always be concerns regarding expectations of shareholders and analysts, customer changes, and technological changes which may disrupt a company\u2019s business. In my opinion, Hasbro currently shows no major signs of weakness and the recent selloff is overdone. I believe only weak results in the third and fourth quarter would validate the idea that Hasbro has problems with its growth. The discounted cash flow model analysis shows that the growth would need to slow down significantly in order to justify the current stock price. In my opinion, the stock is currently undervalued with reasonable upside, which is why I decided to enter into a long position during the past week. Dependent on how conservative you are with your growth rate, discount rate, and margin of safety, Hasbro stock may be worth a second look as a value investor.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please note that all information contained herein is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advice.
