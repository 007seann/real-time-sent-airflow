Whereas Dominion Energy traded for around $74.75 per share on September<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 2, 2016, the stock traded for $78.30 per share on August 30, 2021.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While its stock hasn\u2019t outperformed, there is nevertheless upside given Dominion Energy\u2019s planned capital spending and capital spending on renewables. Dominion Energy has a goal of achieving net zero carbon dioxide and methane from its power and gas infrastructure operations by 2050 and the utility will need to invest a lot of capital to achieve that goal. If the company\u2019s decision on divesting much of its natural gas transmission assets work out, Dominion Energy could also be simpler and more focused.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Capital Spending </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy is planning to invest a lot of capital over the next five years. From 2021 through 2025, the company has a <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_downloads/annual_meeting/2021/2021-Annual-Meeting-Presentation-%28FINAL%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$32 billion</a> growth capex plan with $26 billion expected to be spent on clean energy and clean energy enabling infrastructure. Dominion Energy\u2019s 2021-2025 five year growth capital plan is $10 billion or 43% higher than the utility's prior five year growth capex plan from 2019 to 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy could also have more investment opportunities longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In terms of 2020 to 2035 investment opportunities, Dominion Energy believes it has up to a $17 billion investment opportunity in offshore wind, up to a $20 billion investment opportunity in solar, up to a $7 billion opportunity in energy storage, and up to a $4 billion opportunity in nuclear life extension. The company also believes it has up to a $15 billion opportunity in electric grid transformation and up to a $9 billion opportunity in gas distribution modernization/ RNG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although utilities are undergoing a challenging transition to renewable, regulated utilities can raise rates to compensate if regulators approve. If regulators allow utilities to raise rates enough, utilities could make more money.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Natural Gas</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy has become a simpler company than it was before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In July of 2020, Dominion Energy agreed to sell substantially all of the company's gas transmission and storage segment assets to an affiliate of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The deal was valued at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3588568-berkshire-hathaway-in-10b-deal-for-dominion-energy-assets\">$9.7 billion</a> when including the assumption of $5.7 billion of existing debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given how savvy Warren Buffett is, it remains to be seen whether the divestment is a good decision. With oil prices around $70 per barrel and substantially higher than where it was in July of 2020, the environment for midstream assets is certainly stronger. Natural gas utilities that are state regulated can also often earn fairly attractive returns on equity even with all the challenges they face. Because they provide a fairly essential service, many regulators want utilities to earn a fair return so they can raise the capital they need to operate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nevertheless, selling natural gas transmission and storage simplifies Dominion Energy and reduces the long term adjustment the company would have needed to make given the emergence of heat pumps. Because heat pumps can use electricity that\u2019s generated from renewable energy, heat pumps can generate heat without producing emissions. Although they currently make a small part of the market given the installed base of natural gas furnaces, heat pumps could gain a larger share in the future from new buildings using more heat pumps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy also made the deal to narrow its focus to potentially increase its long term earnings growth. If the company can grow its earnings more with the divestment, the sale will be a good decision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Due to a regulatory hurdle, one part of the deal did not go through. In July of this year, Dominion Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy mutually agreed to cancel the planned sale of the Questar pipeline given regulatory uncertainties. Approximately 80% of the originally announced transaction value is still unaffected, however.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Insider Monkey Holdings</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the filing period ended June 30, 2021, D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw increased its holdings by 40% to 3,867,605 shares. Diamond Hill Capital also increased its holdings by 8% to 3,677,074 shares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Any declines in the market could reduce the valuation of Dominion Energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If interest rates increase, some dividend investors could find treasury bonds more attractive and this could be a headwind for Dominion Energy\u2019s valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the long term, Dominion Energy will eventually need to adjust to distributed energy. With the cost of rooftop solar and battery storage declining, more people could use the grid less.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy will need regulator\u2019s approval to increase its rate base or to increase its rates. If the company doesn\u2019t get enough support from regulators, the utility\u2019s earnings per share could underperform expectations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On average, analysts estimate Dominion Energy will earn $3.87 per share for 2021 and $4.12 per share for 2022. At the stock price of $78.30 per share on August 30, Dominion Energy would have a forward P/E multiple of around 20.2 for 2021 and 19 for 2022. That\u2019s an attractive valuation given Dominion Energy\u2019s growth potential and its moat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Given the company's $32 billion five year program, management expects to grow earnings per share <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4446114-dominion-energy-inc-2021-q2-results-earnings-call-presentation\">6.5%</a> per year through at least 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy\u2019s dividend is also fairly attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a forward annual payout of $2.52 per share, Dominion Energy would have a forward dividend yield of around 3.22% at the stock price of $78.30 per share on August 30. Management also expects to grow dividend per share by around 6% per year through 2025 based on a target payout ratio of ~65%.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With the dividend and assuming Dominion Energy\u2019s P/E multiple doesn't change, there could be around an around 10% shareholder return potential through 2025 if the utility achieves its 6.5% per year through at least 2025 EPS growth goals.</p> </div>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy: $32 Billion Growth Capex Through 2025 Could Mean More Dividends. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4453164-dominion-energy-32-billion-growth-capex-through-2025-could-mean-more-dividends?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24063", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "339946", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "16643", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4453164-dominion-energy-32-billion-growth-capex-through-2025-could-mean-more-dividends", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4453164-dominion-energy-32-billion-growth-capex-through-2025-could-mean-more-dividends", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912060/image_1224912060.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912060/image_1224912060.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912060/image_1224912060.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912060/image_1224912060.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "24063", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "insider-monkey", "userId": 737978, "tagId": 16643, "bio": "Our small-cap hedge fund strategy beat the market by 44 percentage points since its inception 18 months ago.
