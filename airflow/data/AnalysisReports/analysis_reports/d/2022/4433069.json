As such, its annual<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> financial performance is predictable. Including Dominion Energy in your portfolio provides the following two benefits, specific to this utility company.</span></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Dominion Energy promises 10% annual return to its shareholders. 3.2% via dividend and balance by earnings growth.</li> <li>Dominion Energy\u2019s operations has no competition, thus ensuring that the revenues are perpetual in nature</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, no investment is risk free and hence I will also go through the following two risks that your investment might face</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Weather related losses</li> <li>Misalignment of company objective and value creation</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Assured Return of 10%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since their transformation from a major integrated and diversified utility company to a pure play regulated utility company, Dominion Energy has promised a 10% return to its shareholders, 3.2% of which it aims to achieve from dividends and the balance from earnings growth. The 3.2% of dividend return should not be a problem for Dominion Energy. In reality, their dividend policy suggests a 65% payout ratio and since, this is a regulated utility company, barring any major devastation (explained later), shareholders can be certain of positive net income and hence assured dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The balance return of 6.8% that Dominion Energy expects to deliver via earnings growth is complicated because for a regulated utility company, earnings growth depends only on its accretive investments and when those investments are solid enough to generate earnings. Regulated companies operating under the cost-of-service models such as Dominion Energy earn revenues just enough to cover their operating expense plus a marginal return on their invested capital. The point to understand is that assured returns on invested capital do not assure earnings growth for the company. The investment has to result in a positive change in the net PP&amp;E. For example, commissioning a new wind power plant and simultaneously decommissioning another generation unit will not result in an earnings growth. A 1:1 replacement of power plants may result in a negative earnings growth as the new plant is expected to be more cost efficient, which may require a lower charged rate to customer. Other factor to consider is the increasing efficiency in household equipment, requiring even lower amounts of energy and hence lower earnings for Dominion Energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Fortunately, Dominion Energy has a strong pipeline of accretive investments from 2021 to 2035 as shown below. Between 2020-25 planned capital investments are $26 B and Dominion Energy plans to invest $72B by 2035. However, crucial point to note is that between 2020-25, none of the planned expenditures show completion levels anywhere near 100%, meaning that earnings from these expenditures will probably not be realized during this phase of growth. Hopefully, it will be able to deliver smooth commissioning and a steady increase in earnings due to these projects later on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/6/3/51523362-16227436248938527_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"0\" data-height=\"0\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/6/3/51523362-16227436248938527.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Source: Q1 2021 earnings presentation</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No Competition</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy\u2019s primary areas of operation are the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina for electric utilities and Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Ohio for its gas distribution. Dominion Energy\u2019s electric utility do not face any competition in their area of operations. As per their annual report</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>There is no competition for electric distribution service within Virginia Power\u2019s service territory in Virginia and North Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Same goes for their gas operating segment. Dominion Energy Gas customers in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and West Virginia do not have the right to choose their gas supplier. Only in Ohio, customers have the option of choosing their retail gas supplier. Not only there isn\u2019t any existing competition, but there are high barriers to entry, requiring a new entrant to gain approvals at multiple levels of the government. A competition less operating environment allows Dominion Energy to eliminate the guesswork of estimating the number of customers available to it while planning its capital expenditure. A competition less environment makes sure that a new power plant can be run at its peak efficient generation level from day one. From a shareholder\u2019s perspective, this means that convergence of DCF calculated share value and actual market price should be quick and shareholders will not have to wait for market to realize Dominion Energy\u2019s fair value. Of course, there will be some variance to the share price driven supply/demand action by technical traders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Accidental Losses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Damage to properties either due to an accident on-site or due to hazardous weather conditions must be recovered by Dominion Energy on their own dime. Such losses eat away the profit margin of the company and reduce the earnings, based on which annual dividends are paid. Almost every year, there is some storm or the other which causes damage. However, its severity is hardly predictable. Thus, a severe storm can destroy your investment in this company as well as any expected dividends because restoration of public utility facilities will always take precedence over shareholder returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Fiduciary Objectives</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When you invest in a company, it is the responsibility of the board to serve you and create value so that you are its primary beneficiary. Being a utility company, Dominion Energy\u2019s prime objective is not to create value for its shareholders. Its primary objective is to provide utility services to its customers at cheap rates. To that end Dominion Energy has largely been successful. As per their latest filings</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Typical residential customer rates are materially below national (8%), regional (25%), and RGGI-state (35%) averages.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, regulation also stops the company from earning a return akin to essential competitive industries. On the one hand Dominion Energy will be able to give you steady holding period returns, on the other its share performance will never match the returns of the market and thus this represents a huge loss in opportunity cost during times of capital market boom, such as is now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investment Strategy</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy can form a strong base for your portfolio. Its no competition environment and planned capital expenditure indicates that it will be able to return the promised 10% to its shareholders over the next 10 years. However, such investments are not suitable for short- or medium-term investors as variables like commissioning of projects, losses due to weather can disrupt months of capital gains. Also, contrary to popular belief, utility stocks cannot protect your portfolio from inflation risks. Utility stocks are themselves protected against inflation. It's not the same thing. The latest filing from Dominion Energy shows that there is little to no expectation of completion of any project by 2025 and hence, little to no expectation of returns from earnings growth in this period. Divesting your resources to Dominion Energy today can protect your investments from possible future market downturn after increase in interest rates, which is inevitable.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy: A Must Have In Your Portfolio. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433069-dominion-energy-a-must-have-in-your-portfolio?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "105786", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "328017", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "604764", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4433069-dominion-energy-a-must-have-in-your-portfolio", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433069-dominion-energy-a-must-have-in-your-portfolio", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1250427885/image_1250427885.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1250427885/image_1250427885.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1250427885/image_1250427885.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1250427885/image_1250427885.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "105786", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "rohit-acharya", "userId": 51523362, "tagId": 604764, "bio": "<p>I believe in Warren Buffett's value investing principle.
