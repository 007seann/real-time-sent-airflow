Keeping a well-defined clear methodology helps me in achieving my investment goals and makes it easier for me to make decisions.

The deal was completed at the end of 2020, and Dominion received $9.7 billion for these assets. The sale improved the company's balance sheet but hurt its earnings.</p> <p>For Dominion the deal meant that now almost the entire business will be a regulated by the states where it operates. The assets sold were the non-regulated assets, and Dominion will now focus on renewable energy projects and providing electricity at a regulated price. The proceeds will be used for share repurchases, and the dividend was lowered by 33%.</p> <p>I sold my shares in Dominion before the dividend cut. For me to sell shares in a company before it cuts the distribution is rather rare. The reason here was that the dividend reduction was imminent, and the loss of income was significant.</p> <p>However, I have held shares that cut their distribution in the past like V.F. Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFC\" title=\"V.F. Corporation\">VFC</a>) and will reduce their distribution in the future like Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>). Here there were additional reasons that together with the imminent reduction compelled me to sell the shares of Dominion.</p> <h2><strong>My dividend policy</strong></h2> <p>The progressive dividend is my long-term vision of a long-term investment. At the end of the day I am willing to enjoy the free cash flow that my investment creates. I appreciate the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> fact that the management is working to achieve long term growth in the top and bottom lines to fuel free cash flow and dividend growth. It shows the management's confidence when it raises the dividend even when earnings fluctuate.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As a rule of thumb, I sell my position immediately after a company lowers its dividend. From my perceptive, a lower dividend is a failure as the company was either unable to deal with the business environment or didn't conserve enough cash. The company failed to deliver long term growth or needs to take extreme measures to sustain future growth. I am not interested in holding a position in such company. If the management failed to understand the situation of the company and its business environment that led to the dividend cut, I find it harder to trust it in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The reason I do so is that the cut usually signals that there is a problem with the business. When I look into companies that cut dividends in the past like Kinder Morgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI\" title=\"Kinder Morgan, Inc.\">KMI</a>) for example, it took time for the \"new\" Kinder Morgan to stabilize. Dominion had this cut planned, but it would still take time to align the company and finish the buyback program to somewhat negate the EPS decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, even when I take into account the fact that the cut was planned similar to what happened with V.F. Corporation and Pfizer, I am still uncomfortable with the move. In both these cases, the cut wasn't as significant, and the spinoffs pay and will pay enough dividends to keep investors whole.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A 33% decline will require a 50% raise just to break even with previous year dividend, and at a growth rate of 2.5%-6.5%, it will take almost a decade to for the dividend income to simply recover, and that's when I am not even accounting for inflation. Therefore, I find this measure to be too extreme as a dividend growth investor.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Different focus</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dividend by itself is usually enough, but I try to look at the bigger picture. The sale also changed the nature of the company. It used to be a diversified utility which owns unregulated business that can achieve higher growth. After the sale, it became a more conservative utility company with the vast majority of business tightly regulated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company decided to focus on becoming a regulated utility investing in renewables. Yet the proceeds from the sale weren't used to deleverage even more or for investments in the business, but for buybacks. While I appreciate buybacks as an addition to the dividend, having them after a dividend cut is insufficient, especially when the company is going for a big change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I personally don\u2019t appreciate the focus on the regulated business. I prefer utilities that offer investors more than the slow growing utility business. Therefore, I like companies like UGI Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UGI\" title=\"UGI Corporation\">UGI</a>) and Avista (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVA\" title=\"Avista Corporation\">AVA</a>) and I used to like Dominion too.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>My Goals</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When I invest in companies, I look for several types of companies. Type 1 is low dividend yield and high dividend growth, type 2 is medium dividend yield and medium dividend growth and type 3 is high dividend yield and low dividend growth. Personally, I prefer even at the utilities sector to own shares in companies that offer higher than average growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After the cut, Dominion has become a medium dividend company with low growth. Before the sale, the company expected 2.5% dividend growth, and even if it grows at the company's forecasted EPS growth rate of 6.5%, it will take years for the dividend to simply recover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Therefore, that was another reason to sell. There are better options for low dividend growth utilities that offered much higher dividend yield. I replaced Dominion Energy with shares in South Jersey Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SJI\">SJI</a>). I found the dividend to be just as safe, and I expect a similar dividend growth rate of 2%-4% but with a much higher entry yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>My decision</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Each reason by itself can be excused. Usually when a company changes focus, I trust the management team. When a company doesn't fit my goals exactly, I don't sell, I simply don't add. Even when a company suspends the dividend, I avoided selling once with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>). However, the combination of the cut with these significant changes made me sell it in a heartbeat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am willing to reconsider Dominion in the future. It will have to finish its transition first, show some dividend growth, and offer a yield that suits the growth pace. For that to happen I believe the valuation will have to be lower, unless the company will be able to achieve dividend growth rate of 6%-7% long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Companies make changes and transform all the time. They acquire peers, they merge, and they are acquired. I hold many companies that made significant changes, and some of these changes even impacted the dividend, and I didn't sell, because there was no net impact on the dividend. Dominion made a change that has significant impact on the free cash flow, earnings and dividends.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, they changed the focus and created a different type of company that is not aligned with my goals. I will reconsider buying Dominion if they stabilize and grow their dividend again. I do understand that some investors are looking for a conservative regulated utility and they might appreciate the change. However, as a young investor I prefer growth and limited regulation. Therefore, I chose to sell my position in Dominion.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - The Reasons I Sold My Shares In Dominion Energy. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397643-reasons-i-sold-shares-in-dominion-energy?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "80836", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "307790", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "486826", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16696", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4397643-reasons-i-sold-shares-in-dominion-energy", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397643-reasons-i-sold-shares-in-dominion-energy", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/6/20475971-16099447798274887_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/6/20475971-16099447798274887_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "80836", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "khen-elazar", "userId": 20475971, "tagId": 486826, "bio": "<p>Dividend growth investor</p>", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/020/475/971/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/020/475/971/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/020/475/971/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/020/475/971/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Khen Elazar", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2014, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2015, "followersCount": 9182}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "20475971", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "509866", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "509876", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/khen-elazar", "profileUrl": "/author/khen-elazar", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "165", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "d", "name": "D", "company": "Dominion Energy, Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "55", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/D"}}, {"id": "486826", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "khen-elazar", "name": "Khen Elazar", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/khen-elazar"}}, {"id": "16696", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "dividend-investing-strategy", "name": "Dividend Investing Strategy", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=dividend-investing-strategy"}}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "utilities", "name": "Utilities", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/utilities"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-income", "name": "Dividends & Income", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-income"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "electric-utilities", "name": "Electric Utilities", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/electric-utilities"}}, {"id": "307790", "type": "sentiment", "attributes": {"articleId": 4397643, "type": "neutral", "createdAt": "2021-01-06T15:51:38.000-05:00", "typeId": 2}, "relationships": {"article": {"data": {"id": "4397643", "type": "article"}}, "tag": {"data": {"id": "165", "type": "tag"}}}}]}
