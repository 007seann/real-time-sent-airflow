Following the sale of substantially all of its gas transmission &amp; storage assets in 2020, the utility company has narrowed its focus more closely towards<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> clean energy and clean energy enabling infrastructure. The shift towards regulated infrastructure and contracted renewable assets is expected to increase its long-term earnings growth rate and improve revenue reliability in comparison to industry peers.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Regulated Asset Base</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company is now about as close to a pure-play regulated utility company as you can find in large-cap space, with nearly 90% of its operating earnings coming from state-regulated utility operations - an increase from under 75% before the sale of Dominion Energy Gas Holdings to Berkshire Hathaway Energy late last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the owner and operator of state energy infrastructure, Dominion Energy is a natural monopoly in the market, with no effective competition. Regulators do, however, set the rates that utility companies can charge, so that they earn only a reasonable profit for maintaining and upgrading essential infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Regulation can be a double-edged sword. Regulators are obliged to strike a balance between keeping consumer rates affordable and adequately attracting investors to sufficiently finance capital spending required to meet infrastructure needs. As such, adverse regulatory changes can impact the earnings potential of such regulated operations. Against this, however, regulated utility companies have historically found themselves earning predictable revenues. And, as a result, they also enjoy lower borrowing costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Growth Capex</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Virginia-based utility company has one of the largest decarbonization investment opportunities in the industry, with growth capital spending expected to total <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/021221-dominion-energy-plans-to-spend-72-billion-on-decarbonization-by-2035\" rel=\"nofollow\">$32 billion</a> over the next five years. Between 2021 and 2025, it expects to spend $17 billion on zero-carbon electricity generation and energy storage, including plans to develop a <a href=\"https://news.dominionenergy.com/2021-11-05-Dominion-Energy-Submits-Application-for-Coastal-Virginia-Offshore-Wind-with-Virginia-State-Corporation-Commission\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.6 gigawatt offshore wind farm</a> off the coast of Virginia, the largest commercial offshore wind development in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore, $6 billion will be invested in electricity transmission and grid transformation, $3 billion for modernizing its gas distribution network and renewable natural gas, with a further $6 billion towards customer growth and other investments. As such, <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_presentations/2021/03/2021-03-01-DE-IR-March-investor-meetings-vTC-II.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 80%</a>, or approximately $26 billion, of the total growth capex over the next five years will be focused towards decarbonization initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These capex plans should enable the company to grow its rate asset base by around 9% per annum over the next five years. With this in mind, management is confident that this investment opportunity will help drive operating EPS growth to <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/2021-11-05-DE-IR-3Q-2021-earnings-call-slides-vTC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">around 6.5% per annum</a> through 2025, giving it one of the best earnings growth prospects in the sector. Meanwhile, annual dividend growth has been guided at around 6%, with the company targeting a 65% payout ratio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Stock analysts seem equally enthusiastic about Dominion Energy\u2019s earnings growth outlook, with the consensus forecast for adjusted earnings per share for 2021 of $3.88 pointing to an estimated 9.5% growth from 2020, partly due to unfavorable weather in the comparable period last year. For the next two years, EPS growth is forecast to slow slightly, to around 6.2% per annum, with adjusted EPS of $4.12 and $4.38 pencilled in for 2022 and 2023, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/11/saupload_f487550d64fdc2fd1409fbb703e6add0.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite this, Dominion Energy trades a small discount to the sector, with a forward price to earnings ratio of 19.3, compared to the sector average of 20.4. The stock does trade at a tiny premium to some of its large-cap peers, including Duke Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>) and The Southern Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO\" title=\"The Southern Company\">SO</a>), but this should be more than offset by Dominion Energy\u2019s much better growth prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/11/saupload_051aa34394b25a8395a5d70bdceac2fb.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy\u2019s 3-5 year EPS growth estimate is 6.7%, compared to 5.2% for the peer average.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy faces a number of industry risks, as well as risks that are specific to the company. Regulation is typically said to be the biggest risk for utility companies, as firms not only have to adapt to changing legislative and regulatory developments, but also work closely with regulators to approve rates that companies can charge to consumers - this ultimately determining what they can earn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Elsewhere, the risk of interest rates rising more quickly than previously anticipated is another industry-wide concern. Due to the capital-intensive nature of utilities and the long useful life of infrastructure investments, utility companies tend to carry much higher debt loads than other competitive industries. The impact of higher borrowing costs therefore has a relatively bigger impact on the profitability of utility companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Additionally, as utility stocks are often held as income investments, typically acting as bond proxies, because of their reliable dividends, utility stocks are more highly correlated to corporate bonds than stock indexes. Many analysts believe this already explains the recent lethargic performance of the utilities sector, as bond yields have been steadily rising over the past year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Weather is another risk. Unusual weather conditions can impact energy demand, commodity prices, and also the levels of renewable electricity generation - something that will become increasingly relevant in the future. Meanwhile, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and major floods, heightens the risk of outages and property damage to facilities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy\u2019s opportunities in renewables and regulated infrastructure assets look attractive, and this should drive long-term earnings growth ahead of many rivals. At least, so far, things have been on track - the company exceeded analysts' expectations for two out of three quarters in 2021, and only narrowly missed in Q2 2021.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Earnings Date</th> <th>EPS Estimate</th> <th>EPS Actual</th> <th>Surprise</th> <th>Surprise %</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Q3 2021 (Sep 2021)</td> <td>1.06</td> <td>1.11</td> <td>0.05</td> <td>4.59%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Q2 2021 (Jun 2021)</td> <td>0.77</td> <td>0.76</td> <td>-0.01</td> <td>-1.42%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Q1 2021 (Mar 2021)</td> <td>1.08</td> <td>1.09</td> <td>0.01</td> <td>1.38%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: Seeking Alpha <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/earnings/eps-surprise-summary\">Earnings Surprise</a> for Dominion Energy</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite this, the stock has trailed the utilities sector - on a 9.5% year-to-date total return for the sector, Dominion Energy has delivered a total return performance of just 3.2%.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/11/11/saupload_92f66128ccdde9370f5bb3d4b01ee1f4.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy: Strong Growth Potential, But Industry Risks Remain. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468852-dominion-energy-stock-d-strong-growth-potential-industry-risks?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "51092", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "348870", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "106182", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4468852-dominion-energy-stock-d-strong-growth-potential-industry-risks", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468852-dominion-energy-stock-d-strong-growth-potential-industry-risks", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912105/image_1224912105.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912105/image_1224912105.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912105/image_1224912105.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912105/image_1224912105.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "51092", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "junius", "userId": 13226932, "tagId": 106182, "bio": "An anonymous contributor who would like to share some of his ideas.
