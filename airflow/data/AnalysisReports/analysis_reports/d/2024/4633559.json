Well, I guess I'd say I don't think that's been our focus to date. Look, we've got that $6 billion in investment capital a year and some of which can be used for acquisition.

We don't like it. But let's not forget the billions in assets that Enbridge had in place before this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A very large chunk of these assets produce inflation protected cash flows. Enbridge has reached a settlement on its Mainline contracts and has been watching with glee as costs explode on the Trans Mountain expansion. The critical assets are now up for grabs at one of the lowest multiples we have seen in a long time. At 8.3X adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) the stock yields a solid 8%. The payout ratio also comes in 65%, so there is some buffer on that front. The company is one of the few that has delivered such spectacular growth over the long term and kept dividends steady through thick and thin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/6/47392447-1694035752387769_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"904\" data-height=\"646\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/6/47392447-1694035752387769.png\" alt=\"-\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Enbridge Q2-2023 Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The key risk comes from the rating agencies and potentially a severe recession that changes the landscape further. On the first front, Fitch was unmoved with this purchase.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Fitch expects this transaction to modestly increase ENB's leverage, as Fitch expects the company will be issuing incremental debt ahead of acquisition closing, primarily in the form of hybrid instruments, in addition to assuming approximately USD4.6 billion (CAD6.1 billion) of existing LDC debt. As such, Fitch expects leverage to be roughly 0.1x to 0.3x higher than previously targeted over the forecast period, based on the final financing mix and potential near-term rate case outcomes, but remain below Fitch's negative leverage sensitivity of 5.5x. Fitch continues to expect ENB to manage to and remain within its previously stated leverage target range over the forecast period. Fitch considers the diversification benefits and higher contribution from low-risk utility businesses, as well as increased scale to be offset by higher expected leverage, which collectively lead to Fitch's estimation that this transaction is neutral for ENB's credit profile.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/enbridge-incs-ratings-unaffected-by-dominion-gas-utilities-transaction-05-09-2023\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitch</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Moody's and S&amp;P were less sanguine both switched their outlooks to \"negative\".</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We would not amongst the most sanguine on Enbridge. In fact our first foray into the common shares of Enbridge occurred just two weeks back, after it had been beaten down to $34.75. We did some covered calls that we felt could provide a solid yield with low risk. In fact our net cash outlay was just $31.80.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/17/47392447-1692286428640267_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"651\" data-height=\"895\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/8/17/47392447-1692286428640267.png\" alt=\"-\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's App</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As it stands today, we are a little disappointed and think fair value is probably closer to $42 rather than $45. We still think the stock is attractive but the company needs to make a beeline for the 4.5X leverage ratio over the next 3 years. We continue to rate the shares a Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">What About Dominion Energy?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The story on Dominion is a bit different. Once one of the most hyped stocks in the utility sector, the company has produced a really poor return over the last decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/6/saupload_0a21a8d1661f3b2c04bec66ea9de27c6.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In fact Dominion Energy did the same empire building exercise. It was made worse by gangs of overenthusiastic investors rewarding the company with a 25X P/E ratio in the middle of the last decade. So Dominion Energy was to 2015 what NextEra Energy, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEE\" title=\"NextEra Energy, Inc.\">NEE</a>) was to 2022. The valuation compression that followed was predictably painful. Dominion Energy has now sold assets at a premium multiple (16.5X earnings) to where it trades (13X earnings). This comes on the heels of the Cove Point asset sale. All after-tax sale proceeds will be used to pay-off debt. This essentially finishes the derisking of the business. We had a neutral rating on the stock and are upgrading this to a buy as well. As we expect utilities to remain under pressure from interest rate hikes, we would play this defensively using a longer dated covered call for the $45 strike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/6/47392447-16940371939266825.png\" alt=\"-\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's App</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That 16% yield for a flattish price is a good deal for this beaten down utility.</p>", "twitContent": "$D $ENB $ENB:CA - Enbridge: Establishing Dominion Over Regulated Utilities (Rating Upgrade). https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633559-enbridge-establishing-dominion-over-regulated-utilities?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><strong>Are you looking for Real Yields which reduce portfolio volatility?</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1363\">Conservative Income Portfolio</a></strong> targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety.
