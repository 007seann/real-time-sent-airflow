Does the chart agree with that value-based outlook? Well, notice in the chart below that shares are near trendline support that dates back to early 2015. There's resistance, however, in the $67 to $71 range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That is also where the falling 50-week moving average comes into play. What's more, the 200-week moving average is also negatively sloped. Finally, there is a massive amount of shares traded in the $67 to $78 zone - so any penetration to the high $60s should be met with longs looking to unload at breakeven. Still, buying here with a trailing stop could work, targeting the mid-$60s technically. That would generally align with my valuation, too.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">D: Downtrend Support in Play, Upper $60s Resistance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/5/36131525-16832979976017845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"737\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/5/5/36131525-16832979976017845.png\" alt=\"D: Downtrend Support In Play, Upper $60s Resistance\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">StockCharts.com</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I have a buy rating on Dominion following this morning's earnings beat.
