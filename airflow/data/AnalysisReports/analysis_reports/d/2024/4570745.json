In such cases, I take a look at the fundamentals. If there are no red flags evident, I may<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> begin a process of switching horses: transferring capital from a tired stock to a fresh one.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Recently, I found myself in a situation whereby I believe this is the case: venerable Southern Company (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO\" title=\"The Southern Company\">SO</a></span>) and Dominion Energy (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D\" title=\"Dominion Energy, Inc.\">D</a></span>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Both are fine utilities with significant operations in the southern United States; offering investors largely regulated business model, solid operating metrics, and good dividend yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's take a closer look.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Evaluating Utility Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I contend evaluating fundamentals for regulated utility stocks is a bit different than for other sectors. While investors may elect myriad metrics to review, I offer several below that provide a good starting point for further due diligence:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>operating margin</p></li> <li><p>return-on-equity</p></li> <li><p>operating cash flow-to-debt ratio</p></li> <li><p>dividend coverage ratio</p></li> <li><p>electric sales growth</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My rationale for the foregoing is as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Operating margin</strong></em>: an overall business profitability measure that sets aside non-operating net interest expense and taxation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Return-on-equity</strong></em>: another profitability metric that focuses upon how efficiently management utilizes stockholders' investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Operating cash flow-to-debt ratio</strong></em>: a debt leverage check as a function of cash flow instead of profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Dividend coverage ratio</strong></em>: a traditional screening metric to evaluate whether earnings support the current dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Electric sales growth</strong></em>: a measure validating if a company operates in markets with increasing electricity demand.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Let's Compare Southern Company and Dominion</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">To enable a more visual process, I've employed FAST Graphs to highlight the last several years' data. For 2022, I performed the calculations using data from the company's website and / or SEC filings.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating Margins</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">First, here's <em>Southern Company</em>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739862597697067_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1097\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739862597697067.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Company operating margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>fastgraphs.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last five full years, margins have run between 23 percent and 25 percent.

The reduced ratio through September 2022 was exacerbated by a $1 billion delta in deferred fuel and gas costs versus the year prior. Adjusting for this item (which should be recovered within a year) suggests the debt ratio would remain an even 10 percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Bottom line: Debt leverage on an absolute and relative basis is equitable for both utilities.

SO improvement is driven by increasing demand from the industrial segment. Dominion's commercial segment is underpinning the YoY increase.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Summing Up the Fundamentals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Based upon the metrics chosen, it appears Southern Company and Dominion Energy are experiencing:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>above-average operating margins,</p></li> <li><p>equitable / adequate return-on-equity,</p></li> <li><p>reasonable debt leverage,</p></li> <li><p>good dividend coverage, and</p></li> <li><p>growing electricity demand</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It's not evident there is a material separation between these two leading multi-utility companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">How About a Backstory?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition to the fundamentals, investors may ask if recent news events or company narratives warrant concern.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Dominion Energy</strong> </em>stock experienced a significant drawdown after 3Q earnings. The CEO announced he wanted to conduct a thorough business review in order to find opportunities to drive better performance. The message was somewhat puzzling and may have spooked the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Compounding matters, after the 3Q earnings report, some Street analysts revised downward forward EPS and dividend growth forecasts. Whether these developments warranted a 15 percent share price haircut is up for debate. Meanwhile, Dominion management's 3Q earnings presentation and conference call offered no obvious flags regarding future earnings power or dividend growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Southern Company's</strong></em> management indicated the business is on the downhill side of completing the Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear reactors. For years, persistent cost overruns and delays plagued these projects. The overhang appears to have faded. Otherwise, management forward expectations forecast consistent improvement in profitability and dividends. No particular negative developments were cited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On balance, Southern Company and Dominion Energy appear healthy, well-positioned, and well-capitalized regulated utility companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation: A Case to Change Horses?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now to the crux of the matter. Given the fundamental screening test is behind us, it's time to check the second benchmark:</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Here are two FAST Graphs illustrating the valuation dislocation between SO and D stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">First up is <em>Southern Company.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739870838444595_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1088\" data-height=\"687\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739870838444595.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Company price-and-earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>fastgraphs.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The 10-year chart indicates SO stock is somewhat overvalued. The long-term PE is 18x and the current blended PE is nearly 20x. Over the next couple of years, Street analysts expect Southern Company to grow earnings about 7 percent a year, though 2023 is forecast to see a modest profit increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current dividend yield is 3.9 percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now look at the <em>Dominion Energy</em> chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739872177210786_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1083\" data-height=\"682\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/1/17/558993-16739872177210786.jpg\" alt=\"Dominion Energy price-and-earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>fastgraphs.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conversely, D stock appears materially undervalued. The long-term PE is nearly 20x, yet the stock now sports a 15x blended multiple. Despite stock prices tracking earnings reliably in prior years, during the summer of 2022 the shares took a header along with most Utility sector stocks. After rebounding a bit, the stock fell another 15 percent after 3Q 2022 earnings; whereby most large utility stocks did not follow suit. As pointed out earlier, there wasn't any particular news precipitating the fall other than the curious CEO announcement about wanting to conduct a full business review in order to improve operating and equity performance. That seems to have spooked some investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current dividend yield is 4.3 percent.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A Brief Historical Excursion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In 2020, Dominion slashed its dividend in response to cancelling the Atlantic Coast gas pipeline and selling part of the business. At the time, I wrote about these developments in the Seeking Alpha <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4359908-southern-company-safe-solid-utility-stock-for-income-investors\">article entitled</a>, \u201c<em>Southern Company: Safe, Solid Utility Stock for Income Investors.</em>\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I explained it was time to change horses; however, in 2020 it was to swap out of Dominion and buy into Southern Company. I opted to sell Dominion shares ~$80 and buy Southern shares in the low $50s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now the shoe is on the other foot.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">SO is trading at or above Fair Value in the $70 to $75 range while D looks like a deal-on-the-cheap: accumulate in the low $60s range.
