Upon closer examination, the company regularly carries a heavy debt load and appears to be becoming<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> less financially healthy over time. I am recommending a Hold for Dominion Energy because the financial situation of the company is too poor for me to be comfortable buying it for the long term.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Company Background</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and provides electricity and natural gas to <a href=\"https://investors.dominionenergy.com/home/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">about 7 million customers</a> in 16 states. Like many Utility Companies in the United States, they have pledged to be net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has long history of mergers and divestitures, but I am going to only bring up two of them. In 2018, Dominion stepped in and bought SCANA Corporation in the wake of the Nukegate scandal. Dominion <a href=\"https://www.wfae.org/energy-environment/2019-01-02/dominion-completes-purchase-of-south-carolinas-troubled-scana\" rel=\"noopener\">paid for the purchase</a> with $6.8B in shares, and also took on an additional $6.6B in debt. This dilution shows up later in my charts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The second transaction I want to bring up was when Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) announced <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/05/warren-buffetts-berkshire-buys-dominion-energy-natural-gas-assets-in-10-billion-deal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">they were buying</a> natural gas assets from them in 2020. Dominion was trying to shed $5.7B in debt during the transaction. Over a year later, Berkshire would <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-1dafb9f7f66ab6ed5688aaa9072e100e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">change its mind</a> about buying Questar Pipelines from Dominion. Within a few months of Berkshire backing out, Dominion Energy <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-gas-holdings-completes-acquisition-of-questar-pipeline-from-dominion-energy-301452388.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold the pipeline</a> to Southwest Gas Holdings who now owns it through a subsidiary named MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Long Term Trends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The CAGR for both <a href=\"https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/natural-gas-global-market-report#:~:text=The%20natural%20gas%20market%20size,the%20market%20in%20the%20future.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural Gas</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/united-states-power-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. power grid,</a> as well as the Inflation Reduction Act will all provide <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-and-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-work-together-to-advance-climate-action#:~:text=The%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20will%20help%20decarbonize%20the%20U.S.%20electric,over%20the%20next%2010%20years.\" rel=\"nofollow\">sustained tailwinds</a> for utility providers in the United States, including Dominion Energy. The federal government is subsidizing a major equipment update. Typically, this is where I would cite a few facts about the <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-and-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-work-together-to-advance-climate-action#:~:text=The%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20will%20help%20decarbonize%20the%20U.S.%20electric,over%20the%20next%2010%20years.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and state that I like that the company has chosen to try to achieve net zero emissions; but instead, I'm going to talk about interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Federal Reserve has a long term average inflation <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">target of 2%</a>, and this typically comes with a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/02/23/how-does-the-fed-define-maximum-employment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">loose job market</a>. In its quest to fight inflation, the Fed is expected to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-now-expects-three-more-fed-rate-hikes-2023-2023-02-17/\" rel=\"noopener\">continue hiking rates</a> and then keep them elevated <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">for a while</a> before lowering them. Expectations for the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARRL\" rel=\"nofollow\">timing and pace of lowering</a> fluctuate as events unfold, but current projections estimate it will be around 4.9% by the end of 2023, 3.1% by the end of 2024, and 2.4% by the end of 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking at annual revenue over the last decade shows that the company has been growing. Their operating income has been stable, but their net income hasn't. Net income has been declining since they posted $2.999B in 2017, and by 2022, it was only $994M. The reason I am inclined to treat their 2021 net income as an outlier, is because a significant portion of the $3.288B was from unusual items and not regular operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/22/58059340-1679513362780928_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1253\" data-height=\"142\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/22/58059340-1679513362780928.jpg\" alt=\"dominion unusual items D energy\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Unusual Items (Seeking Alpha - Dominion Financials)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794522561612413_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1917\" data-height=\"1439\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794522561612413.jpg\" alt=\"dominion energy annual revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Annual Revenue (Blake Downer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating margins have stayed fairly stable; this is a major positive. What jumps out here are the significant fluctuations in net margins from year to year. Utilities are subject to variations from both short term seasonality and the long term price movements of fuel, so although this might look alarming, this volatility is perfectly normal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-1679452269338928_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1911\" data-height=\"1434\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-1679452269338928.jpg\" alt=\"dominion energy margin\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Annual Margins (Blake Downer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I always look at the relationship between float, cash, and revenue to get a sense for how well a company translates dilution into revenue. This does not include the accounts receivable that utility companies like to group with cash on their balance sheet. What I don't like here is that the increase in share count was not followed by a significant rise in revenue. The share count rose from 585.5M in 2013, to 835.2M in 2022, a 42.6% rise. Over that same time, revenue rose from $13.12B to $17.17B, a 30.9% rise. Even when dilution is accretive, it is typical for the revenue increases to lag behind the dilution events. But when the long term pace of dilution is higher than the pace of revenue growth, it's a red flag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794522923343444_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1913\" data-height=\"1433\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794522923343444.jpg\" alt=\"dominion energy float cash revenue dilution\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Float vs Cash vs Revenue (Blake Downer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When I decided to take a deeper look into their balance sheet and cash flow statements, it became more clear that this company has a debt problem. Since operating income varies from year to year, their relatively stable interest payments are causing a significant drag on their net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794523211169078_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1433\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-16794523211169078.jpg\" alt=\"dominion energy interest expense income\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Income vs Interest (Blake Downer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since 2013, short term liabilities have grown from $6.99B to $13.45B, a 92% rise. Over that same time, current assets have gone up 66% from $5.94B to $9.85B. Accounts receivable went from $1.69B to $2.95B, a 75% rise.

The seasonal swings in demand driven revenue affect each company uniquely. For this company it means weakness in their second quarter revenue, and strength in the fourth and first quarter of every year. Dominion also traditionally has negative net income in the second quarter of every year. I don't like that the most recent quarterly net income was negative even though previous Q4's have been good earners for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-1679452496697814_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"1429\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/3/21/58059340-1679452496697814.jpg\" alt=\"dominion energy revenue quarterly\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dominion Quarterly Revenue (Blake Downer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Their quarterly margins tell a similar story.

If the company were to incur a major unexpected expense or drop in revenue, they would be in danger of having to either dilute or take out more loans to raise funding. This puts them at risk of either falling behind on their ability to keep pace with their debt, or lowering EPS through dilution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If inflation proves to be stickier than the Fed is expecting, then they will be forced to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/7/13/23188455/inflation-paul-volcker-shock-recession-1970s\" rel=\"nofollow\">raise rates suddenly</a> and this company, along with all of the rest that are used to carrying a high debt load, will suffer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If the Federal Reserve were forced to lower rates ahead of schedule, it could be a boon for this company. The present rate of expected lowering is gradual, but a black swan event could force the Fed lower suddenly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since 2017, revenue has been rising while net income has been going down. Ignoring the outlier caused in 2021, net margins have experienced a contraction over that same time period. Share count has been outpacing revenue growth. Their short term debt obligations are rising faster than their assets or their accounts receivable. They regularly carry high debt and a significant portion of their operating income goes toward making interest payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even though the discounted cash flow calculator produced a fair value estimate of about $50, I am not willing to buy into this company. For me, their financial situation looks too unhealthy. I would be concerned that the dividend cut they experienced at the end of 2020 was not a one-time event and that the company might have trouble maintaining dividend growth. In order to turn me into a buyer, Dominion Energy would first have to slash its dividend even further to a level where it can begin aggressively paying down its debt obligations. I would need to see evidence the health of the company was improving.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For those of you who have more conviction in this company than I do, today's price of $53.21 per share is fairly close to the calculated fair value of $49.94, and the near future may present even better buying opportunities. If I were planning on investing into Dominion Energy, I would keep my overall position size small and sell out of the money covered calls against the shares. I would also not reinvest dividends. My goal would be to lower my cost basis as fast as possible.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Why I Won't Be Buying This Dip On Dominion Energy. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589818-not-buying-dominion-energy-dip?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "106941", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "445803", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "689279", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115492", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "548896", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4589818-not-buying-dominion-energy-dip", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589818-not-buying-dominion-energy-dip", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912113/image_1224912113.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912113/image_1224912113.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912113/image_1224912113.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1224912113/image_1224912113.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "106941", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "blake-downer", "userId": 58059340, "tagId": 689279, "bio": "<p>I am an Electromechanical Engineer.
