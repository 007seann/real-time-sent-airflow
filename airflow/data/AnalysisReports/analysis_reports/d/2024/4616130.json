The problem is that not every stock that is suffering offers buying opportunities. That's where <strong>Dominion Energy (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D\" title=\"Dominion Energy, Inc.\">D</a></span>)</strong> comes<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in. This utility giant with a market cap of $44 billion has been struggling - big time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While utilities, in general, aren't the best tools for capital gains, Dominion is currently more than 40% below its all-time high. It's down 15% year-to-date, and it has cut its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/10/saupload_c2cccf09c84a19633dbc037c8746a617.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, the company is still yielding 5.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In this article, I'll assess the risk/reward of what looks like a dumpster fire that yields 5% but is dealing with regulatory issues, a potential debt downgrade, and the usual struggles in the utility sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, let's get to it!</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Struggling Giant - With A 5% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I own Duke Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>). It's my only utility investment. While I also like several other players that I regularly discuss on Seeking Alpha, I'm not a huge fan of the industry. Regulated utilities need to carefully deal with billions in additional costs related to the energy transition, rising input costs, and a ton of regulatory issues - all while maintaining affordable rates for their customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000715957/000095017023003287/d-20221231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000715957/000095017023003287/d-20221231.htm\" target=\"_blank\">company</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p><em>Dominion Energy is committed to safely delivering sustainable, reliable and affordable energy and achieving net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Essentially, this is a more fancy way of describing what I just wrote about balancing costs and prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company operates in 15 states, serving roughly 7 million customers. Its asset portfolio includes significant electric generating capacity, transmission and distribution lines, and gas distribution mains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy's strategic goal is to be a leading sustainable provider of electricity, natural gas, and related services in the eastern and Rocky Mountain regions of the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Around 90% of Dominion Energy's earnings from its primary operating segments are expected to come from state-regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Furthermore:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Dominion Energy's growth capital expenditure plan for 2022 through 2026 focuses on upgrading the electric system in Virginia. It includes investments in renewable generation facilities, such as utility-scale solar and offshore wind projects.</li> <li>The company also plans to extend the licenses for its regulated nuclear power stations in Virginia.</li> <li>Other growth drivers include renewable natural gas initiatives, gas distribution pipeline replacement and modernization, and upgrades to transmission and distribution networks to meet environmental requirements.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Last year, the company launched a major business review to improve its business and boost its stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/10/31557165-16889786325433834_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1308\" data-height=\"634\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/10/31557165-16889786325433834.png\" alt=\"Image\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Wall Street Journal</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As reported by the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominion-energy-launches-business-review-to-boost-stock-11667565199\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominion-energy-launches-business-review-to-boost-stock-11667565199\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p></p> <p data-type=\"paragraph\"><em>Chief Executive Officer Bob Blue on Friday said that the Richmond, Va., energy company intends to review alternatives to its current business mix and capital allocation, and assess regulatory options to assist its customers with managing costs.</em></p> <p data-type=\"paragraph\"><em>[...] \"Like everyone, we are seeing inflation, supply chain limitations and higher fuel prices-all having an impact on customer rates and our balance-sheet strength,\" Mr. Blue said.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unfortunately, the company's turnaround plan included cutting its dividend to achieve a more sustainable payout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/10/saupload_870a341a9c1aee018a2afdbeab02c182.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On November 4, 2020, the company cut its dividend by 33%. Since then, the company has hiked its dividend once, which was in December 2021, when the company hiked by 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, D shares yield 5.1% with a 67% payout ratio, which is marginally above the sector median of 64%. In other words, for now, the dividend is safe - although a lot of investors have lost trust already.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now What?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Things are slowly improving. For example, in Virginia, the company's largest service area, significant developments have taken place. As discussed in the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4600579-dominion-energy-inc-d-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\"

<li>This forecast indicates a significant increase in peak load by 2033.</li> <li>Dominion Energy Virginia has observed strong sales growth over the last 12 months, with an expectation of moderate growth of around 5% for the full year 2023.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unfortunately, because of the company's ongoing business review, it did not issue full-year guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, the company told us about its credit, which isn't looking so great at the moment. For now, the company has a BBB+ credit rating, which is one step below the A-range.

While potential business improvements will enhance EBITDA well beyond the next 12 months, Dominion Energy is trading at 11.4x NTM EBITDA. While this is the lowest valuation among the largest electric utility companies, it's not a major outlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/10/saupload_6ffeb964f5a637dbd3d801f10db90466.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current consensus price forecast is $59, which is 13% above the current price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, there is a steep downtrend in the consensus, as analysts aren't willing to price in a rebound at this point.

As a struggling utility giant facing regulatory issues, potential debt downgrades, and the challenges of the utility sector, Dominion Energy's future is uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the company has taken steps to improve its business and reduce costs, such as cutting its dividend and reviewing its operations, there are still concerns about its credit rating and overall financial health. The recent negative outlook from S&amp;P suggests that countermeasures may be needed to strengthen Dominion's credit metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although Dominion Energy operates in a growing market and has the potential for improvement, it's important to consider the company's history of underperformance and the fact that it's not trading at a significant discount compared to its peers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Considering the risks involved, income-seeking investors may find better opportunities with lower risk and a more favorable long-term risk/reward profile than Dominion Energy is currently offering.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion's 5% Yield: Is The Juice Worth The Squeeze?. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616130-dominions-5-percent-yield-is-the-juice-worth-the-squeeze?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p><strong>Test Drive iREIT\u00a9 on Alpha For FREE (for 2 Weeks)</strong></p><p>Join <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1026\"><strong>iREIT on Alpha</strong></a> today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1026\"><strong>Nothing to lose with our FREE 2-week trial</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1026\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/8/31557165-16888227846415408.png\"></a></p><p>And this offer includes a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1026\">2-Week <strong>FREE TRIAL</strong> plus Brad Thomas' FREE book</a>.</p>", "marketingBullet": "Looking for more investing ideas like this one?
