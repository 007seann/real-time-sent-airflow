However, even while looking at them on a quarterly basis, their returns are still unappealing. As of the most recent earnings report, ROIC was 0.05%, ROCE was 0.94%, and ROE was at 2.11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/2/58059340-16936766716727989_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"564\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/2/58059340-16936766716727989.png\" alt=\"d dominion return on invested capital equity employed roic roce roe\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">D Quarterly Returns <span>(By Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As of September 1st, 2023, Dominion had a market capitalization of $40.06B and traded for $47.88 per share. They currently have a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E</a> of 13.88x, an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/growth\">EPS Long-Term CAGR</a> of -2.85%, and a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/dividends/yield%0d\">forward Yield</a> of 5.58%. Using these values I calculated a PEGY of 5.084x and an Inverted PEGY of 0.1967x. Multiplying the inverted PEGY by today's share price produces a fair value estimate of $9.42 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If I instead chose to take a look at value from a discounted cash flow perspective, I get a noticeably different result. Using a discount rate of 9%, their present <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/dividends/scorecard\">annual payout of $2.67</a>, their projected dividend <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/dividends/dividend-growth\">10Y CAGR of 1.89%</a>, and assuming they can maintain this growth rate for the full 20 years, I calculated a fair value estimate of $38.26 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/4/58059340-16938774745496957_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1547\" data-height=\"586\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/9/4/58059340-16938774745496957.jpg\" alt=\"d dominion dividend history\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">D Dividend History <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion has a significant debt load. The Fed is already in a position where it is holding rates at an elevated level in order to lower inflation and loosen the job market. If inflation were to begin rising again, the Fed would be forced to raise rates further. Their already significant debt load could become even more of a burden.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company would directly benefit from a lowering of interest rates. With consumers already used to an inflationary environment, they also stand to benefit from any price hikes they can pass on to their customers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The last time I examined Dominion, their most recent financials were for the quarter ending in December 2022. At the time long-term debt was $37,730M while quarterly unlevered cash flow was -$678.1M. Currently, they have $38,134M in long-term debt, and quarterly unlevered cash flow is -$1,599.5M. The situation has only gotten worse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, Dominion appears to be saddled with negative cash flow due to a combination of their debt and their dividend obligations. Instead of buybacks being used to power up dividend increases and producing attractive yield on cost for long-term holders, they have been plagued with dilution and were forced to cut their dividend in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This most recent quarter, Dominion only had an operating income of $892M, yet paid $558M in dividends and $430M in net interest expense. I know most of the long-term holders are not going to want to hear this, but I believe they have painted themselves into a corner and are very quickly running out of options. Even if they somehow work out a deal where they stop paying interest on their debt and are able to devote 100% of their operating income to paying down their principal, their $37,730M in long-term debt would take 42.3 quarters to pay all the way down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For me to consider adding them to my black swan list, I would first require that Dominion slash its dividend to zero and focus on paying its debt down for at least the next 5-7 years. This may sound heretical to some of you, but I consider it incredibly irresponsible to continue paying out unsustainable yield in the face of crippling debt. When faced with a conflict of interest, I believe companies should <em>always</em> prioritize the long-term health of the company over short-term shareholder returns.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Because of their significant debt risk, if I were to open a position in Dominion Energy, I would not reinvest the dividends. Instead of turning on the DRIP, I would instead attempt to take risk off the table by lowering my cost basis as quickly as possible. I would look to sell covered calls on the position while moving all of the dividends and premium collected to other investments.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy: Still Too Much Debt For Me To Consider Buying. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633252-dominion-energy-still-too-much-debt-for-me-to-consider-buying?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "106941", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "483380", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "689279", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115492", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "115172", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "608068", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114692", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "114682", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "698258", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4633252-dominion-energy-still-too-much-debt-for-me-to-consider-buying", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633252-dominion-energy-still-too-much-debt-for-me-to-consider-buying", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1549695693/image_1549695693.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1549695693/image_1549695693.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1549695693/image_1549695693.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1549695693/image_1549695693.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "106941", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "blake-downer", "userId": 58059340, "tagId": 689279, "bio": "<p>I am an Electromechanical Engineer.
