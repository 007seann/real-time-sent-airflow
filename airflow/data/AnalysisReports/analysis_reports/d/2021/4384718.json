It may not matter. In fact, I do not believe this is the best way to think about this utilities stock. Rather, it might belong in a portfolio for another key reason.</p> <p>Especially in the case of long-term growth with some level of risk control, this stock has historically been a great diversification tool. Since 1985, Dominion's monthly returns have correlated with those of the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) by a factor of only 0.29. This means, in practice, that the stock barely dipped during the 2000-2003 bear. Meanwhile, it sometimes performed poorly during times of stock market enthusiasm (e.g., late 2017-early 2018).</p> <p>Historically, blending stocks like Dominion inside an equities portfolio would have helped to produce much better results over time. See the chart and table below. Portfolio 1 is a 50/50 blend of D and SPY, while Portfolio 2 is a pure S&amp;P 500 play. Notice that the first strategy would have led to nearly 25% improvement in risk-adjusted returns compared to the benchmark (Sharpe ratio of 0.68 vs. 0.55 for the broad market), while being less exposed to drastic drops from all-time highs (i.e., maximum drawdown).</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/40779175-16044471527303069_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"806\" data-height=\"544\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/40779175-16044471527303069.png\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"432\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>(Source: </p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion: Still Worth A Shot Ahead Of Earnings. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4384718-dominion-still-worth-shot-ahead-of-earnings?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<h2>Beating the market by a mile</h2><p>Members of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1078\">Storm-Resistant Growth</a> community will continue to get updates on NEE (allocation updates, insights, etc.) and the performance of my market-beating \"All-Equities SRG\" portfolio on a regular basis.
