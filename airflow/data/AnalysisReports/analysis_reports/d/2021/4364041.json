Indeed, Dominion\u2019s electricity demand was less affected by the pandemic than many other utilities. Nonetheless, some of the changes at the company since February are not pandemic-related.</p> <p>After lengthy legal and regulatory battles, and despite a Supreme Court win, Dominion Energy <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2020/07/05/duke-energy-dominion-abandon-the-atlantic-coast-p.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">has canceled</a> the $8 billion Atlantic Coast gas pipeline project which it had undertaken with Duke Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>). Note that the pipeline was meeting demand: its capacity was over 90% subscribed for 15 years. As in the Northeast, and due in part to the decisions against the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline, this suggests a hostile regulatory and judicial environment, exacerbated locally by Virginia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-43-Expanding-Access-to-Clean-Energy-and-Growing-the-Clean-Energy-Jobs-of-the-Future.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Executive Order 43</a>, which targets zero hydrocarbon use for Virginia's electricity by 2050. At present, Dominion\u2019s generation mix - primarily for electricity sales in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina - includes 12% coal and 42% natural gas.</p> <p>Moreover, Dominion is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/05/warren-buffetts-berkshire-buys-dominion-energy-natural-gas-assets-in-10-billion-deal.html#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett\" rel=\"nofollow\">selling some of its natural gas storage and transmission assets</a> to Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) for $4.0 billion in cash and $5.7 billion of debt assumption. Gas storage and transmission as a sector is separately notable, since Berkshire Hathaway has a reputation for buying undervalued assets.</p> <p>The asset sale will reduce operating earnings, and so, the company expects to reduce its dividend from $3.76/share (4.7% yield) to an <a href=\"https://www.dividendpower.org/2020/07/13/dominion-energy-d-dividend-cut/\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated $2.50/share</a> starting in 2021 (a 3.1% yield at the current stock price).</p> <p>Although Dominion Energy operates in several states besides Virginia, Virginia is its core. The hostile governmental (Executive Order 43), judicial, regulatory and environmental (cancellation of the well-subscribed Atlantic Coast pipeline) conditions necessitating an asset sale to Berkshire Hathaway and upcoming dividend reduction suggests investors should<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> wait out Dominion\u2019s retrenchment.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Second-Quarter 2020 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Pandemic shutdown effects on electricity use in Dominion\u2019s service areas were less than expected. For the March-July 2020 period, electricity use in the mainly (87%) Virginia-North Carolina service territory was <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2020-07-31-DE-IR-Q2-2020-earnings-call-slides-vTCII.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">actually up by 0.2%</a> compared to the 2018-2019 average for the same period. However, between March and July 2020, electricity use in the South Carolina service territory was down by -3.9% compared to the 2018-2019 average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The difference between the two service areas reflects different mixes between higher residential demand and lower combined commercial/industrial demand that has been experienced from the coronavirus-caused shutdowns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, the Energy Information Administration expects <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/#:~:text=EIA%20expects%20the%20share%20of,2019%20to%2041%25%20this%20year.&amp;text=Coal\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. electricity use</a> to be lower by a <em>huge -4.2%</em> for full-year 2020 relative to 2019, implying a very large decline in the second quarter and subsequent recovery in the third and fourth quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For the second quarter of 2020, Dominion Energy\u2019s <a href=\"https://investors.dominionenergy.com/news/press-release-details/2020/Dominion-Energy-Announces-Second-Quarter-Earnings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">net loss was -$1.2 billion</a>, or -$1.41/share, compared to a net gain of $54 million for the same period a year ago. Operating earnings for the quarter were $706 million, compared to $619 million for the second quarter of 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In 2Q20, the -$2.8 billion impairment charge for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project was only somewhat offset by a $400 million gain from the company\u2019s nuclear decommissioning trust and a $550 million income tax benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion expects 2020 operating earnings of $3.37-3.63/share (down from a pre-COVID-19 estimate of $4.25-4.60/share).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company\u2019s operating earnings by segment for 2Q20 were:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Dominion Energy Virginia, +$437 million (62% of net total);</li> <li>Gas Transmission and Storage, +$184 million;</li> <li>Gas Distribution +$87 million;</li> <li>Dominion Energy South Carolina, +$75 million;</li> <li>Contracted Generation, +$21 million;</li> <li>Corporate and Other, -$98 million.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Asset Sale to Berkshire Hathaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In early July 2020, Dominion announced it was selling gas transmission and storage assets to Berkshire Hathaway for $4 billion and the assumption of $5.7 billion in debt, or almost $10 billion. This includes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dominion-m-a-berkshire/buffetts-berkshire-to-buy-dominion-energy-gas-assets-for-4-billion-idUSKBN2460TN#:~:text=Buffett\" rel=\"nofollow\">7700 miles of natural gas transmission lines and</a> 900 billion cubic feet (BCF) of storage: specifically, Dominion Energy Transmission, Questar Pipeline, Carolina Gas Transmission, 50% of the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, and 25% of the Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Maryland. Dominion will retain 50% of Cove Point and Brookfield Asset Management owns the remaining 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As noted above, in the second quarter of 2020, the gas transmission and storage segment being sold to Berkshire Hathaway contributed $184 million in operating earnings, or 26%. Gas transmission and storage earnings for the first six months of the year was similar at $405 million in operating earnings out of $1.64 billion, or a 25% share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. Once closed, with earnings from these assets no longer going to Dominion, the company expects to cut its dividend to 65% of remaining operating earnings, or about $2.50/share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Net-Zero Initiative and Virginia Executive Order 43</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion\u2019s Net Zero initiative aligns with Virginia Executive Order 43 for decarbonization throughout the state.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Several states, including Virginia, (but not North Carolina or South Carolina, also both served by Dominion), are targeting partial or full decarbonization by 2030-2050. The primary carbon fuels to generate electricity have been coal and natural gas. Virginia has not legislated a goal, but it has implemented an executive order targeting 30% clean generation fuels by 2030 and 100% clean generation fuels by 2050. Clean fuels are defined as hydropower, solar, wind, (aka \"renewables\") <em>and</em> nuclear. As the graphs below show, because of the sizable contribution of nuclear, Dominion is already reaching this goal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another near-term goal specific to the state government: \u201cThe Commonwealth shall procure at least 30 percent of the electricity under the <em>statewide</em> electric contract with Dominion Energy from renewable energy resources by 2022.\u201d</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Electricity Fuel Generation Sources</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4362798-dominion-energy-inc-2020-q2-results-earnings-call-presentation\">earnings call slides</a>, Dominion notes that in 2019 natural gas was 42% of its electric generation fuel and renewables were 4%. The company expects a significant ramp-up by 2035 of renewables to 33% and a ramp-<em>down</em> (at least on a percentage basis) of natural gas to 26%. This is illustrated below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/718170-15964888360894535.png\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"289\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/718170-15964888691951618.png\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"289\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Data Source: Company website)</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Natural Gas Prices</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/718170-15964887852756732.png\" data-width=\"477\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Low natural gas prices (shown above) benefit Dominion\u2019s electricity customers due to lower costs for gas-fueled generation. This cost advantage will dissipate in Virginia as natural gas use becomes increasingly limited in the state's electricity generation due to Executive Order 43.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, do note that post-Berkshire sale, generation in North Carolina, in Dominion\u2019s South Carolina operations - which will comprise 15% of its earnings - and the six states shown below in its gas distribution segment - which will comprise another 15% of its earnings - have not enacted policies requiring Dominion to reduce either the direct sale of natural gas for heating and other applications or the use of natural gas for electricity generation. This energy flexibility will benefit the natural gas and electricity consumers of those states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/718170-15964887325975096.png\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"351\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Image Credit: Seeking Alpha)</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Governance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recently ranked Dominion Energy\u2019s overall governance as 8, with sub-scores of audit (1), board (6), shareholder rights (7), and compensation (9). On the ISS scale, 1 represents lower governance risk and 10 represents higher governance risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At July 15, 2020, shorted shares were only 1.3% of floated shares. Insiders own a fractional 0.28% of outstanding shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion\u2019s beta is 0.43: its stock moves directionally with the overall market but with less volatility, as is typical for utilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4363115-dominion-energys-d-ceo-tom-farrell-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript\">Senior management changes</a> effective October 1, 2020: current chairman, president, and chief executive officer Tom Farrell will become executive chair; Bob Blue will become president and CEO; and Diane Leopold will become the chief operating officer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Competitors and Dow Jones Utility Index Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Utilities have no exact competitors - they have a monopoly on their service areas in exchange for regulation - but they can be compared to one another, especially in the 15-stock Dow Jones Utility Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJU\" title=\"Dow Jones Utilities Average Index\">DJU</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nor are utilities uniform in approach. They vary by their regional economies\u2019 growth, by level of non-regulated businesses, and by whether their state governments and public utility commissions are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/12/2019-was-watershed-year-clean-energy-commitments-us-states-and-utilities\" rel=\"nofollow\">limiting their generating fuel sources</a>, as many - including Virginia - are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With the sale of its natural gas transportation and storage, Dominion will become much more focused (about 90%) on regulated utilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">By contrast, utilities with revenue from non-regulated merchant sales include Exelon Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXC\" title=\"Exelon Corporation\">EXC</a>) and NextEra Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEE\" title=\"NextEra Energy, Inc.\">NEE</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Other Financial and Stock Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At June 30, 2020, Dominion had $72.84 billion in liabilities and $103.73 billion in assets, resulting in a steep-but-utility-standard liability-to-asset ratio of 70%. Again, the sale of assets to Berkshire Hathaway will reduce debt by $5.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Market capitalization is $67.4 billion at an August 3, 2020 closing stock price of $80.33 per share. Dominion\u2019s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/D?p=D\" rel=\"nofollow\">52-week price range</a> is $57.79-90.89 per share, so its August 3, 2020 closing price is 88% of the high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company expects 2020 operating earnings per share of $3.50 for a current price-to-earnings ratio of 23.0. Analysts\u2019 average estimate for 2021 EPS is $3.86 for a forward P/E of 20.8.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Market value per share is two and a half times book value per share of $31.53, indicating positive investor sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The current dividend of $3.76/share represents a 4.7% yield. However, the company\u2019s new dividend of an estimated $2.50/share starting in 2021 would represent a dividend of 3.1%/share at today's stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The mean overall rating from eighteen analysts is 2.7, or \u201cHold\u201d leaning slightly toward \u201cBuy.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/saupload_3ba69106c74aa04cbaf6fd0652dfd592.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"430\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Positive and Negative Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition to the pandemic recovery and Virginia regulatory risks, with a liability-to-asset ratio of 70%, Dominion is more exposed to interest rate increases than companies in other sectors. However, interest rate increases appear unlikely for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Recommendations for Dominion Energy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I do not recommend Dominion Energy to growth-seeking or dividend-hunting investors. Although the company has surfed the pandemic shutdowns without a terrible demand loss, the extreme resistance it encountered in trying to build the Atlantic Coast pipeline - despite its Supreme Court win - resulting in the cancellation and the company\u2019s $2.8 billion write-off of its shares speak to the negative environment in which it operates in the Virginia part of its service territory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The sale of gas assets to Berkshire and follow-on expected dividend cut reduces the attractiveness of a stock in a sector in which investors expect healthy dividends. It is possible the company\u2019s stock price will fall to align with the lower expected operating earnings, an unappealing prospect for growth investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is also disappointing to see the company not pushing back on Virginia\u2019s unrealistic executive guidance to replace all (cheap) hydrocarbon-fueled electricity generation - especially given nearby plentiful natural gas - with nuclear and intermittent, more-expensive renewables.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Those interested in Dominion should wait for the post-Berkshire sale shakeout of lower dividends and likely lower price after the fourth quarter.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/8/3/718170-1596488699898764.png\" data-width=\"175\" data-height=\"62\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>", "twitContent": "$D - Why I Sold Dominion Energy. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364041-why-i-sold-dominion-energy?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>I hope you enjoyed this piece.
