Yet <strong>Dominion Energy</strong> (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D\" title=\"Dominion Energy, Inc.\">D</a></span>) didn't participate in the rally as fully as its peers (see below). That's because investors are still smarting from a cut in the dividend following the sale of a majority of its Gas Transmission &amp; Storage (\"GT&amp;S\") assets to <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) and the cancellation of the ACP project (the <a href=\"https://news.dominionenergy.com/2020-11-02-Dominion-Energy-Closes-on-Sale-of-Majority-of-Gas-Transmission-Storage-Assets\" rel=\"nofollow\">asset sale closed</a> on November 2nd). However, these developments will reduce overall risks and - combined with a pivot to renewables - will transform Dominion into a pure-play state regulated utility which will put it on a path to more stable cash-flow and a potentially higher dividend growth profile going forward.</p> <p>Since the S&amp;P500 set its most recent record on September 2nd, the utility sector has gained ~6% while other supposedly safe sectors like consumer staples and healthcare sold-off, as did gold.

Note that, based on full-year operating income guidance (see below), at the midpoint ($3.50/share) Cove Point equates to ~14% of full-year operating income. The point is, even during a year of very low O&amp;G prices, if Dominion has to have an unregulated business, Cove Point is a jewel of an asset to have in that category.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Pivot To Renewables</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Virginia's <a href=\"https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-43-Expanding-Access-to-Clean-Energy-and-Growing-the-Clean-Energy-Jobs-of-the-Future.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Executive Order 43</a>, pretty much forced Dominion's hand when it comes to renewables. The Executive Order is a plan \"to produce thirty percent of Virginia's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030 and one hundred percent of Virginia's electricity from carbon-free sources by 2050.\" That's a challenge for Dominion considering for full-year 2019 12% of electrical power generating capacity came from coal and 42% came from natural gas (see slide 18 of the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2020-07-31-DE-IR-Q2-2020-earnings-call-slides-vTCII.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 presentation</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That said, when it comes to renewables Dominion isn't starting from ground zero:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>It is already the 3rd largest utility in terms of solar power assets and has already achieved its near-term renewable goal of 3.0 GW of capacity.</li> <li>Last month Dominion <a href=\"https://news.dominionenergy.com/2020-10-14-Dominion-Energys-Coastal-Virginia-Offshore-Wind-Turbines-Complete-Final-Step-To-Start-Serving-Virginia-Customers\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> two-turbine offshore wind energy pilot project passed testing and went in-service.</li> <li>That pilot project is a step toward a proposed 2.6 GW commercial project which would be the largest announced offshore wind project in North America.

The spend is expected to result in an earnings CAGR of ~6.5%. I would expect dividend growth to roughly follow the growth in earnings starting next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Note that Dominion plans to use the ~$3 billion in cash from the GT&amp;S asset sale for share repurchases (the deal just closed on Monday). At the current share price of $82.50, that equates to about 36.4 million shares, or an estimated 4.3% of the average 839.4 million shares outstanding as of the <a href=\"https://news.dominionenergy.com/2020-07-31-Dominion-Energy-Announces-Second-Quarter-Earnings\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 EPS report</a>. While that is not enough to significantly boost 2021 EPS in my opinion, it is a nice tailwind which should generally support the stock price in light of the dividend cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Speaking of the Q2 EPS report, while reported GAAP earnings were a loss of $1.2 billion ($1.41 per share), the loss was due to a ~$3 billion impairment charge related primarily to the cancellation of the ACP and Supply Header projects. Absent the charges, operating earnings were $0.82/share which bodes well in comparison of the $2.52/share annual dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q3 earnings are due out on Thursday. I don't expect any big surprises other than updates on some of the new renewable projects and perhaps slightly tighter guidance for Q4 and the full-year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Company guidance for Q3 operating earnings is in the range of $0.85-$1.05 per share. Full-year 2020 in a range of $3.37-$3.63 per share. At the midpoint ($3.50/share) the P/E=23.6x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For 2021, the consensus estimate is for $3.87/share (see below), for a Fwd P/E=21.3x. That would put Dominion inline with <strong>American Electric Power</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEP\" title=\"American Electric Power Company, Inc.\">AEP</a>), but at a premium to <strong>Duke Energy</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>) and <strong>Southern</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO\" title=\"The Southern Company\">SO</a>) - both of which currently have Fwd PE's in the neighborhood of 18.5x. One could argue that D does not deserve that premium at the present time, but looking out a year or so, it appears warranted given the outlook for dividend growth, Cove Point, and the increased amount of sustainable renewable capacity and more growth projects in the queue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/173432-1604425419869563_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"729\" data-height=\"123\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/173432-1604425419869563.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"108\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"108\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D/earnings\">Seeking Alpha</a></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My take on Dominion is that overall risks have been reduced as a result of:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The midstream asset sales and proceeds thereof.</li> <li>The cut in the dividend.</li> <li>The pivot away from pipeline/midstream expenditures and toward renewables.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The dominance of regulated utilities businesses - which guarantee a decent rate of return - in the portfolio, combined with the Cove Point asset that just prints money, means Dominion is as strong as it has been in quite some time in my opinion. Little comfort for those who had their dividend cut, but perhaps a good enough reason to stay invested.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That said, the current Fwd P/E putting Dominion at a premium to peers Duke and Southern going forward, which does not seems justified unless Dominions comes in toward the top of Q3/Q4 and full-year guidance. If not, shares could be exposed to a ~10% downdraft in order to get to a P/E=18.5 (i.e. closer to Duke and Southern).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Hurricanes, tropical storms, and floods have been, and will likely continue to be, fairly common events in Dominion's operating region and can damage utility assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Regulatory and commodity price exposure (natural gas) are a risk, but <span>Dominion's clean energy assets should attract premium power pricing going forward. That said, the company needs to figure out how to retire its coal generating capacity as quickly and as economically as possible, with natural gas power capacity - at least in Virginia - being a secondary priority.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Summary &amp; Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Honestly, I started this article thinking it would be a slightly bearish piece due to my anecdotal knowledge of Dominion's dividend cut and the initial impression that left with me. Yet as I started researching the company, I realized that I actually liked what was happening: the midstream assets sale, the pivot to renewables (granted, that was forced by the state of Virginia), and the share buyback plan to support the stock through the transformation. The estimated 6.5% dividend growth outlook (starting in 2021) actually looks positive in my opinion. I would HOLD Dominion here, and take advantage of any price pull-backs to the ~$78 level as a buying opportunity. Meantime, the 3% yield is very attractive given the <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2020/09/17/federal-reserve-jerome-powell-fomc-interest-rates-us-economy-pandemic-recovery/\" rel=\"nofollow\">near zero interest rate environment</a> that is expected to last out to 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I'll end with a 5-year stock price chart of Dominion:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/saupload_ab89049d0c7def31ad5c646a3a79a096.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by</figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion: Retrenching For A Renewable Future. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4385480-dominion-retrenching-for-renewable-future?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "21702", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "299247", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "158", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "7967", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "155", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "195", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "239", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "11018", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4385480-dominion-retrenching-for-renewable-future", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4385480-dominion-retrenching-for-renewable-future", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/173432-16044131045941546.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/3/173432-16044131045941546.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "21702", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "michael-fitzsimmons", "userId": 173432, "tagId": 11018, "bio": "Michael Fitzsimmons is a retired electronics engineer and avid investor.
