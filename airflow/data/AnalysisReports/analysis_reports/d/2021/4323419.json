Since information from China is tightly controlled, comments about the accuracy of official reports of the number of infections and deaths are mixed; the numbers may be higher. Hubei province-60 million people-was quarantined and most businesses were forced to close. Travel during Lunar New Year was discouraged. Many countries halted travel to and from China to prevent the epidemic from becoming a pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This coronavirus was first suspected by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-doctor-who-issued-early-warning-on-virus-dies-11581019816\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Li Wenliang</a> in late December 2019, who was subsequently forced by local authorities to admit to \"illegal behavior.\" Dr. Wenliang's death from the virus sparked substantial unrest. In 2018, Dinny McMahon's book <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/dinny-mcmahon/chinas-great-wall-of-debt-shadow-banks-ghost-cities-massive-loans-and-the-end-of-the-chinese-miracle\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>China's Great Wall of Debt</em></a> suggested precisely such unrest could occur if growth stalled and lead to political instability as Chinese citizens became more suspicious of their government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While many people are now back to work, many others are not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Uncontested is that the combined Lunar New Year and coronavirus business shutdown has deeply affected many global markets for whom trade and travel with China is key. One of these is the spot market for liquefied natural gas (LNG), now trading in Asia at a <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/lng-japan-korea-marker-platts-swap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">JKM reference price</a> of $2.89/MMBTU for April 2020 delivery. This is less than the price for which it can be shipped from the U.S. China has declared <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-06/chinese-gas-buyer-cnooc-declares-force-majeure-on-lng-contracts\" rel=\"nofollow\">force majeure</a> on existing LNG contract take commitments. Additionally, the first phase of the tariff deal that takes effect February 14, 2020 does not change the 25% tariff China has placed on U.S. LNG, further driving down its price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These issues do not directly affect Dominion's Cove Point LNG exports which are sold under 20-year take-or-pay contracts without a commodity price adjustment to Japanese utilities and to an Indian trading company. It does affect uncontracted cargoes, such as some from Cheniere Energy Partners (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CQP\" title=\"Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. Common Units\">CQP</a>) and Cheniere Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNG\" title=\"Cheniere Energy, Inc.\">LNG</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Macro Environment-U.S. Gas Prices</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">LNG exports had been a hoped-for bright spot for natural gas producers experiencing dismal prices due to warmer winter weather as shown below. The closing NYMEX March natural gas futures price on February 11, 2020 was $1.80/MMBTU. The <a href=\"https://www.naturalgasintel.com/data/data_products/daily\" rel=\"nofollow\">Appalachian</a> and Questar (Rockies) gas prices--two of Dominion's service areas--were lower, most recently at approximately $1.60/MMBTU and $1.50/MMBTU, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/2/11/718170-15814728472714097.png\" data-width=\"477\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Compounding this, several northeast and west coast states including Virginia but not others in Dominion's territory, are targeting <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/12/2019-was-watershed-year-clean-energy-commitments-us-states-and-utilities\" rel=\"nofollow\">full or partial</a> decarbonization by 2035-2050. The primary carbon fuels to generate electricity have been coal and natural gas. Virginia has not legislated a goal, but it has implemented an executive order for 100% clean (fueled by solar, wind, and nuclear) electricity by 2050.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As described in the Growth section below, Dominion Energy is developing a Net Zero program that aligns with Virginia's clean energy targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/2/11/718170-15814690551048253_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"865\" data-height=\"519\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/2/11/718170-15814690551048253.png\" alt=\"U.S. electricity generation\" width=\"624\" height=\"374\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Low gas prices benefit both Dominion's natural gas customers directly and its electricity customers, due to lower costs for gas-fueled generation.</strong></em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Electricity Fuel Sources</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Of its five operating segments, electricity generation occurs in three<em>: Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina,</em> and <em>Contracted.</em> Compared to its 2005 generation fuel mix, the biggest flip-flop is coal (from 47% in 2005 to 12% in 2019) and natural gas (from 7% in 2005 to 42% in 2019).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/2/11/718170-1581469380070643.png\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"289\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Data Source: dominionenergy.com</strong></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Net Zero Initiative</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion's Net Zero initiative is aimed at net zero carbon (dioxide) and methane by 2050, mirroring Virginia's state goals. Net Zero comprises programs ranging from substituting electric school buses for diesel school buses, reducing coal-fired generation, enhancing natural gas pipeline leak detection and replacing old distribution lines, extending the lives of the company's nuclear units, and investing in solar and offshore wind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion expects to reduce methane emissions by 65% by 2030 and 80% by 2040. These programs also dovetail with safety goals (pipeline replacement), fuel diversity (solar and wind), and electricity growth (electric buses).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Capital Expenditures and Growth Prospects</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion <a href=\"https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/EventConsoleApollo.jsp?&amp;eventid=2152270&amp;sessionid=1&amp;username=&amp;partnerref=&amp;format=fhaudio&amp;mobile=&amp;flashsupportedmobiledevice=&amp;helpcenter=&amp;key=0FE288F820074DF3ED9E374CC92433EC&amp;newConsole=false&amp;nxChe=false&amp;text_language_id=en&amp;playerwidth=748&amp;playerheight=526&amp;eventuserid=270647648&amp;contenttype=A&amp;mediametricsessionid=227117494&amp;mediametricid=3036162&amp;usercd=270647648&amp;mode=launch\" rel=\"nofollow\">emphasizes that 70% of its revenues</a> come from state-regulated business and are centered in what the company calls \"the highly attractive states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, and Utah.\" Electricity demand ties directly to regional economic activity, and the company experienced 1.4% year-over-year sales growth demand from entities such as 26 new data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another 25% of Dominion's business is FERC-regulated storage operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Natural gas demand is a significant function of these regions' weather (for commercial and residential use), industrial use, and electrical generation demand, and export demand. In many of Dominion's service areas, customers prefer natural gas heat: the alternatives are (higher-carbon-emissions) fuel oil or wood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Having so far spent $3.4 billion on Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP), the company is awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court decision on its Appalachian Trail Crossing. If in service by 2022 as planned, ACP is expected to contribute 20-25 cents per share of earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion expects to make $8 billion of capital expenditures in 2020: $2.4 billion for maintenance and $5.6 billion for growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has also announced plans for a major offshore wind development totaling 2.6 gigawatts at a cost of $8 billion with a full in-service date of 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Governance</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At February 3, 2020 Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) ranked Dominion Energy's overall <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/D/profile?p=D\" rel=\"nofollow\">governance</a> as a (weak-for-a-utility) 8, with sub-scores of audit (1), board (8), shareholder rights (7), and compensation (8). On the ISS scale, 1 represents lower governance risk and 10 represents higher governance risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At December 31, 2019, shorted shares were only 1.7% of floated shares. Insiders own a negligible percentage of outstanding shares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dow Jones Utility Index Comparison and LNG Competitors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion's utilities have no exact competitors-utilities have a monopoly on their service areas in exchange for regulation. However, among utility companies, Dominion is far less focused on merchant sales than, for instance, Exelon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXC\" title=\"Exelon Corporation\">EXC</a>) or NextEra (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEE\" title=\"NextEra Energy, Inc.\">NEE</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In LNG operations, Dominion's major U.S. competitor to Cove Point is Cheniere. Utility company Sempra (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRE\" title=\"Sempra\">SRE</a>) operates Cameron LNG.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Notes on Valuation and Beta</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's market value per share is two and a half times its book value per share of $33.65, indicating positive market sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion's beta is <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/D/fundamental/beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.22:</a> its stock moves directionally with the overall market but with much less volatility, as is typical for utilities, and part of their appeal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Positive and Negative Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although Dominion serves several geographic areas there is no assurance the economies of the regions will balance one another or move counter-cyclically to one another. They could instead reinforce one another, with all being strongly negative or strongly positive due to national rather than regional factors such as tax policy or interest rate changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a liability-to-asset ratio of 67%, Dominion, like the utility sector generally, is more exposed to interest rate increases than companies in other sectors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Recommendations for Dominion Energy</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite its higher stock price, low governance score, and anomalous price/earnings ratio, Dominion Energy is attractive for its good state regulatory environments, its forward-looking plans to incorporate nuclear, solar, and wind in a clean-sourced electricity push, the growth in its service areas, and its attention to infrastructure, particularly distribution pipe replacement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While extraordinarily low LNG prices may put indirect pressure on the company's LNG export (but which are under long-term contract to non-Chinese buyers), the current very low gas prices benefit both its natural gas customers and its electricity customers: Dominion is particularly advantaged by fueling 42% of its electricity generation with natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The completion of Atlantic Coast Pipeline continues to carry legal, regulatory, and financial risk, as does its multi-billion-dollar commitment to offshore wind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I recommend that investors looking for stable, low-beta stocks with a good dividend consider Dominion. Utility investors will like its fuel mix that emphasizes nuclear and natural gas, while ESG investors will find the Net Zero initiatives of interest.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/2/11/718170-15814692031796982.png\" alt=\"Dominion Energy Logo\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" data-width=\"175\" data-height=\"62\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy: Dividend Love In The Time Of Coronavirus. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323419-dominion-energy-dividend-love-in-time-of-coronavirus?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>I hope you enjoyed this piece.
