Most importantly, almost all (~95%) of Dominion Energy's assets are now considered regulated/regulated-like utility operations, versus just ~40% back in 2006 (regulated/regulated-like utility operations generate very stable cash flow streams that are predominantly influenced by regulators and rate cases, making those assets ideal for income-oriented investors). We like Dominion Energy's pivot towards stability and management's commitment to rewarding shareholders via dividend increases, but caution there are potential downside risks to be aware of. Shares of D yield 4.6% as of this writing.</span></p> <h2>Overview</h2> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611381006350744_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1066\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611381006350744.png\" alt=\"A picture containing text, map Description automatically generated\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>Image Shown: A snapshot of Dominion Energy's operations now that its combination with SCANA Corporation is complete.

The equity side of the deal was valued at $6.8 billion by the time of closing and Dominion Energy also took on $6.6 billion in net debt, making the entire transaction worth $13.4 billion. Having a presence in both the regulated electric and natural gas utility space across 18 states mitigates a decent chunk of the unsystematic risks in Dominion Energy's corporate profile as far as utility go (in terms of reducing geographical and business concentration risk).</p> <p>We support Dominion Energy <a href=\"https://news.dominionenergy.com/2019-01-28-Dominion-Energy-Dominion-Energy-Midstream-Complete-Merger\" rel=\"nofollow\">rolling up</a> Dominion Energy Midstream Partners LP (which is now a fully-owned subsidiary) in a move completed this past January.

The firm generated $4.8 billion in net operating cash flow last year, up 15% from 2016 levels, while spending $4.3 billion on capital expenditures as defined as 'plant construction and other property additions (including nuclear fuel).' However, note that management expects Dominion Energy's capital expenditures to grow back towards $5-6 billion over the coming years, hitting ~$5.0 billion in 2020 and ~$6.0 billion by 2023. When combined with annual dividend payments that hit $2.2 billion in 2018, note that Dominion Energy needs to retain access to capital markets at attractive rates in order to sustain its business model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-1561138100528523_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1066\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-1561138100528523.png\" alt=\"A picture containing screenshot Description automatically generated\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy expects to increase its capital expenditures over the coming years to support its growth trajectory by expanding its rate base.

Considering Dominion Energy's growing net operating cash flows, investment grade credit rating, large asset base, and the stability regulated utilities provide, it should keep able to keep tapping capital markets at reasonable rates. If the US FED decides to cut interest rates, Dominion Energy would be a major beneficiary.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dividend Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management has aggressively pursued dividend increases since 2016, growth that was made possible through solid operating income growth per share. Over the long-term, Dominion Energy is targeting a payout ratio in the low 70s% which will be achieved in part through a significant slowdown in the growth of its per share dividend payments as you can see in the picture below. While Dominion Energy expects to grow its annual per share dividend by 10.0% in 2019, that growth rate will climb down to 2.5% in the 2020s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611381005717967_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1066\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611381005717967.png\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy has steadily boosted its per share dividend payouts over the past few years, resulting in a significantly higher payout ratio.

Growing as a regulated utility is largely a function of capital expenditures expanding the company's rate base and successful rate cases allowing for revenue increases. Fluctuations in energy consumption, particularly electricity and natural gas demand in the regions Dominion Energy's utility operations service, will cause a moderate amount of volatility in its financials in any given year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-1561138100547929_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1066\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-1561138100547929.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy has posted solid operating income per share growth this past decade.

In a past article covering Duke Energy Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>), which can be viewed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4270681-duke-energys-transformation-story-is-largely-complete\">here</a>, we wrote that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p>There are some risks involved with this strategy, more so on the natural gas side, as the ~$7.4 billion (at the midpoint of guidance) <a href=\"https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/about/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlantic Coast Pipeline project</a> might not get the needed regulatory approval to advance any further. Dominion Energy is the lead developer (<a href=\"https://www.whsv.com/content/news/New-hearing-rejected-for-pipeline-to-cross-Appalachian-Trail-506352261.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">48% interest</a> in the endeavor), and unfortunately Dominion Energy has run into numerous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3466277-atlantic-coast-pipeline-seeks-appeal-extension-from-supreme-court\">legal roadblocks</a> preventing the firm from completing construction activities in certain areas. As Duke Energy <a href=\"https://www.duke-energy.com/annual-report/_/media/pdfs/our-company/investors/de-annual-reports/2018/2018-duke-energy-annual-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">owned 47%</a> of the development as of the end of 2018, legal and regulatory hurdles are material to its financials as well. The goal of the project is to build a 600-mile long pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, linking prolific natural gas supplies from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in Appalachia to the East Coast.</p> <p>Dominion Energy had a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dominion-us-pipeline-natgas/u-s-asks-supreme-court-for-more-time-on-atlantic-coast-natgas-pipe-appeal-idUSKCN1SS2FM\" rel=\"nofollow\">permit vacated</a> by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals last year that allowed the firm to build the pipeline across the Appalachian Trial on National Forest Land. Construction activities were halted in December 2018, and if that legal ruling isn't successfully appealed, the project may be canceled as rerouting the pipeline doesn't appear financially feasible (keeping in mind this project had already been delayed before and cost estimates are on the rise). We will be monitoring this situation going forward. Duke Energy noted it has a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3445432-duke-energy-needs-plan-b-atlantic-coast-pipeline-fails-good-says\">\"Plan B\"</a> if things don't work out, but management is sticking with the current course for now. Dominion Energy remains <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/061119-dominion-confident-it-will-win-atlantic-coast-pipeline-legal-challenges\" rel=\"nofollow\">optimistic</a> the pipeline will be operational by 2021, but in order for that to happen, the company is attempting to get the US Supreme Court to take a look at its appeal of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another potential downside consideration involves the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-20/trump-weighs-limits-on-uranium-imports-after-security-risk-found\" rel=\"nofollow\">potentially</a> imposing import quotas on uranium or forcing domestic nuclear power plants to purchase domestically produced uranium in greater quantities. Dominion Energy has <a href=\"https://www.dominionenergy.com/company/making-energy/nuclear\" rel=\"nofollow\">significant</a> nuclear power generation operations and the industry expects these protectionist moves (justified by the administration over national security concerns) would drive up fuel costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Note that global LNG spot prices are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/singapore-pavilion-investment/update-3-asias-pavilion-gets-access-to-europe-lng-terminals-with-iberdrola-exit-idUSL4N23R1LW\" rel=\"nofollow\">very subdued</a> right now, which could negatively impact Dominion Energy's <a href=\"https://www.dominionenergy.com/company/moving-energy/dominion-energy-transmission-inc/facilities-projects-and-programs/cove-point\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cove Point</a> LNG export terminal in Maryland. However (according to Dominion Energy's <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000715957/36653660-06d3-436d-9449-89555ea02fc9.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018 10-K</a>), \"Cove Point's gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the Liquefaction Project's capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements\" which means the firm isn't directly exposed to changes to global LNG prices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Concluding Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our rigorous discounted free cash flow analysis indicates the potential fair value of Dominion Energy is between $54-$80 per share, indicating shares of Dominion are currently trading at the upper end of our fair value range. This is likely due to excitement over the prospects of the US Fed cutting interest rates, and potentially due to Dominion Energy pushing through more aggressive dividend increases in the recent past. We aren't as interested in shares as things stand today but appreciate Dominion Energy's pivot towards the regulated utility space.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Dominion Energy's Dividend Growth Strategy. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4272286-dominion-energys-dividend-growth-strategy?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "24491", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "47110", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "165", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "155", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "34650", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18027", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18029", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4272286-dominion-energys-dividend-growth-strategy", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4272286-dominion-energys-dividend-growth-strategy", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611380999375124_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/6/21/933684-15611380999375124_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "24491", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "valuentum", "userId": 933684, "tagId": 34650, "bio": "<p>We offer subscriptions and exclusive newsletters.
