Please note that the cash flows of rate regulated utilities are very stable and that these utilities can borrow heavily to grow their rate regulated asset base at leverage levels most industries couldn\u2019t handle outside of say, the REIT or oil and gas infrastructure space.</p> <p>We like Dominion\u2019s shift towards rate regulated utilities and its decent yield, with shares of D yielding 4.7% as of this writing. However, please note management is slowing down Dominion Energy's payout growth rate to allow for a more sustainable dividend policy over time, a strategy we will cover in this article. We are still on the sidelines for now as we are waiting for further signs of how the US Fed plans to proceed given that utilities would be major beneficiaries of lower interest rates.</p> <h2>Background Info on Utilities and Dominion Energy\u2019s Financials</h2> <p>Rate regulated utilities grow by issuing a combination of debt and equity to fund capital expenditure budgets that usually consume most (if not all) of the internally generated funds those companies produce (defined as net operating cash flows). Equity issuances are required to balance out the capital structure of those utility companies as debt issuances alone can quickly lead to leverage problems. For the most part, the capital expenditure budgets of growing utilities are going towards cash flow generating projects, with the regulatory environment ensuring those cash flows are strong enough to support investment in the space.</p> <p>Ultimately, the goal of the utility is<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to grow operating EPS (a non-GAAP measure the industry enjoys using) by expanding their rate base while keeping shareholder dilution as tame as possible, with rising operating EPS making per share dividend growth possible. Rising net debt loads grow in tandem with EBITDA generation, allowing for leverage ratios to remain manageable over time assuming everything goes according to plan.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The rate regulated projects utilities are investing in include anything from adding smart meters to the electricity grid, upgrading natural gas distribution infrastructure and replacing old pipelines, building out new electricity transmission lines and replacing old networks, and constructing new power generating assets in rate regulated electricity markets (as some power markets in the US are \u201cregulated\u201d and some are \u201cderegulated\u201d). Note that power generation projects in \u201cderegulated\u201d regions/states can have their future expected cash flows secured through PPAs, power purchase agreements, which often is the case with green energy projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From 2006 to 2019 (based on management\u2019s estimates), Dominion Energy sees the rate regulated or like-rate regulated side of its business growing from ~40% to ~95% of total operating income generation as you can see in the graphic below. Total operating income has almost doubled during this period. Please note that ~65 - 70% of Dominion Energy's total operating income comes from rate regulated utilities, ~25 - 30% comes from gas transmission &amp; storage assets that are either regulated by FERC or have stable enough cash flow profiles to be \"regulated-like\" assets (in the eyes of management, we will cover that in more detail later on), and the remainder comes from power generation assets under long-term contracts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921227998266_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1109\" data-height=\"832\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921227998266.png\" alt=\"A picture containing screenshot Description automatically generated\" width=\"626\" height=\"470\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy has effectively become a near-pure-play on rate regulated natural gas and electric utilities in America. Image Source: Dominion Energy \u2013 <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_presentations/2019/03/2019-03-25-DE-IR-investor-meeting-general-session-vTCII-website-version.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">IR Presentation</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">While the financial performance of the Cove Point LNG export terminal will clearly be impacted by market forces over the long term, note that some of that risk has been mitigated by Dominion Energy securing the capacity of the project \u201cunder long-term fixed reservation fee agreements\u201d but that doesn\u2019t completely remove market pricing risk. From Dominion Energy\u2019s <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_downloads/annual_meeting/2019/03/Annual-Report-on-Form-10-K.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018 10-K</a> filing;</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Cove Point\u2019s gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the Liquefaction Project\u2019s capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements. However, in the future Cove Point may compete with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies on the basis of terminal location, services provided and price. Competition from terminal operators primarily comes from refiners and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. In addition, Cove Point\u2019s Liquefaction Project may face competition on a global scale as international customers explore other options to meet their energy needs.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now let\u2019s pivot to Dominion Energy\u2019s cash flow situation. Down in the graphic below is a look at Dominion Energy\u2019s cash flow statement from 2016 to 2018. Note that net operating cash flows were less than capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017, but Dominion Energy did post positive free cash flows in 2018 (when net operating cash flows exceeded capital expenditures). Its annual dividend commitment averaged a bit over $1.9 billion during this three-year period and stood at $2.2 billion in 2018 (outpacing $0.5 billion in free cash flow that year, highlighting Dominion Energy\u2019s need to retain access to capital markets).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921228318808_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"654\" data-height=\"773\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921228318808.png\" width=\"495\" height=\"585\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"756\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy\u2019s growth strategy leaves little if any free cash flow to cover its annual dividend commitments, which is why the company needs to retain access to capital markets.

The <a href=\"https://investors.dominionenergy.com/fixed-income/dominion-energy/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">big three</a> agencies all rate Dominion Energy\u2019s unsecured debt as investment grade (Baa2/BBB/BBB+) with stable outlooks, indicating the company should retain relatively easy access to capital markets as things stand today. A lower interest rate environment, courtesy of the US Fed in particular, could be a major boon for Dominion Energy (with room for upside if rates keep moving lower as Dominion Energy's cost of debt will likely move lower as well).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion Energy plans to put downward pressure on its annual operating and maintenance expenses over the next few years through productivity improvements and by keeping its headcount contained as you can see if the graphic below. That should help pad its financial performance going forward and may assist in keeping leverage levels contained (assuming the company's EBITDA generation firms up due to the cost savings and other operational improvements). We are very supportive of utilities that are constantly looking for ways to improve their financial performance, even if it is \"just\" along the margins. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-1565894253137842_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1109\" data-height=\"832\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-1565894253137842.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"480\" alt=\"\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Image Shown: An overview of how Dominion Energy plans to keep operating expenses contained going forward.

Management reiterated guidance for $4.05 - $4.40 in operating EPS in 2019 noting that \u201cyear-to-date results and our second half outlook are supportive of our existing 2019 operating earnings guidance\u201d in the press release. For reference, Dominion Energy generated $4.05 in operating EPS in <a href=\"https://investors.dominionenergy.com/news/press-release-details/2019/Dominion-Energy-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Earnings-Provides-Atlantic-Coast-Pipeline-Update/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018</a>, indicating that management expects decent annual growth (~4%) at the midpoint of guidance in 2019. Using its latest annualized dividend payout, Dominion Energy expects to support a coverage ratio (operating EPS dividend by dividend per share) of ~87% in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That doesn\u2019t leave room for payout growth in excess of operating EPS growth, which is why going forward, Dominion Energy expects to grow its payout by 2.5% annually over the coming years as you can see in the graphic below. Dominion Energy\u2019s dividend per share will grow at a slower rate than its expected operating EPS growth, allowing for its payout ratio to move materially lower over time (towards the low 70s%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921232810447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1109\" data-height=\"832\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/15/933684-15658921232810447.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated\" width=\"626\" height=\"470\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Image Shown: Dominion Energy is sharply slowing down its dividend per share growth going forward, versus historical levels, to allow for better payout coverage over time as its operating EPS is expected to grow at a faster rate.

Again, we want to highlight that Dominion Energy can manage large capital investments, its dividend commitments, and its large debt load by retaining relatively easy access to capital markets as debt can be refinanced and cash flow shortfalls can be met by outside funds (via equity/debt issuances).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Looking Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Going forward, management has identified ~$26 billion in growth capital investments from 2019 \u2013 2023 as you can see in the graphic below.
