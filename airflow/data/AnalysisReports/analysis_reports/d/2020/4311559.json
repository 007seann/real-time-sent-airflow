For the full-year 2019, EPS of $4.15-4.30 implies a forward P/E of 18.4-19.25. At this multiple, Dominion Energy stock is neither undervalued nor overvalued. Its peer, <strong>Southern Company</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO\" title=\"The Southern Company\">SO</a>), has similar P/Es but its dividend yields below 4%.</p> <p>DIY value investors may demand deeper value and a higher yield. For example, <strong>TC Pipelines</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCP\">TCP</a>) has a forward P/E of 10 times and a dividend that yields 6.89%. Although this is an apples to oranges comparison, the point is that investors should diversify into pipelines as well as electric utilities.</p> <p><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\" data-id=\"null\" data-name=\"null\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/12/9/saupload_f6d21925d63716118fd8d5bbea2a4e7b.png\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" alt=\"Chart\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\">Data by YCharts</figure></p> <p>At a 5% EPS growth rate, Dominion trades at a PEG of over 12 times. Investors are buying up Dominion stock because the company will recapitalize $2.1 billion in equity. So, by establishing a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, the company will use 100% percent of the proceeds to retire parent-level debt. This is a continuation of the company improving its balance sheet and reducing its business risk profile in 2018.</p> <h2>Dominion Becoming a Value Play Again</h2> <p>After Dominion shares fell by ~$4.00 on no news, investors seeking value may want<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to start a position or add to an existing one. The company will reduce debt by around $2 billion this year. DEGH (Dominion Energy Gas) will have a total debt of between $5.1 and $6.1 billion by the end of this year. That will give the unit a total debt/EBITDA of 4 times in 2020.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">DEGH will have an EBITDA of $1.5 billion in 2020, with DETI and Cove Point contributing the most.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Potential Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion\u2019s pipeline project could face cost overruns, but because the potential burdens are shared, risks are greatly reduced. On the conference call, management said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quote paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>This is clearly a demand-driven pipeline. And we are in very constructive negotiations with the customer for fair rates to their customers as well as fair returns for us and more comfortable with the returns that we\u2019ll get for the pipeline.<br><br>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4301568-dominion-energy-inc-d-ceo-thomas-farrell-on-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript\">SA Transcript</a></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Dominion mitigated negative media coverage for its SCANA merger in South Carolina by staying out of the headlines. When it closed the transaction, it focused on providing reliable gas and electric service at fair rates for customers. By engaging favorably with the community, Dominion did not have many conflicts to manage. The company only needed to handle extraordinary events like electricity loss. For example, when 40% of its customers lost electricity, Dominion restored the service within three days.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Upside and Downside Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investors may assume a terminal revenue multiple of 6.1 times in a 10-year DCF Revenue Exit model.

Conversely, investors who want a 15 times terminal EBITDA multiple in a 5-year DCF EBITDA Exit model will come up with an upside <a href=\"https://finbox.com/s/m-xea195hq?pi=fnbox&amp;ai=oj32jt3\" rel=\"nofollow\">fair value</a> of $90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With interest rates at historic lows and no rate hikes expected in the foreseeable future, investors should consider buying Dominion Energy for the 4.53% dividend yield. The utility stock consistently beats guidance on an EPS basis and continues to work down its debt levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After dipping ~$4, Dominion is a good stock to consider accumulating at current levels.</p>", "twitContent": "$D - Why Buy Dominion Energy For The Dividend Income Yielding 4.53%. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4311559-why-buy-dominion-energy-for-dividend-income-yielding-4_53-percent?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": "<p>Dominion Energy was featured on the DIY Marketplace last year.
