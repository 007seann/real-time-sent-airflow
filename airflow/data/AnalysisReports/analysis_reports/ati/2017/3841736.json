A perfect storm of lower oil, nickel, and stainless steel prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar have pummeled the demand for and pricing of ATI's products, particularly in the Flat-Rolled Products (\"FRP\") segment. With Chinese steel companies continuing to dump steel on North American markets, an oil market share war in full swing, and ongoing union labor negotiations at a standstill, there appears little reason for optimism.</p> <p>Allegheny Technologies Incorporated's 4Q15 earnings reinforced this view. Volume and pricing tumbled, charges were taken, and the enterprise fell further into the red. Increased cash burn and dividend sustainability (even after ATI's recent dividend reduction) are now becoming real concerns. The only silver lining at this point appears to be ATI's long-term agreements (\"LTA's\") with commercial and defense aerospace OEM's and engine manufacturers, but even these contracts appear vulnerable to swings in nickel pricing, as is the case with much of ATI's contracted volume.</p> <p>With Allegheny Technologies Incorporated trading around $8, it's tempting to try to call the bottom here. But management's ages old line that \"aerospace demand will drive increased volumes, asset utilization and higher margins in 2H16\" was first touted years ago, never materialized, and so is falling on deaf investor ears. Such is the nature of lost management credibility. At this point, investing in ATI is akin to investing in Nickel pricing, and I can think of better ways to realize Nickel exposure. So I remain on the sidelines and will watch with interest for any clues that ATI's financial performance may rebound.</p> <p><strong>Plummeting volumes destroys asset utilization and margins</strong></p> <p>Allegheny Technologies Incorporated manufactures stainless steel, specialty metal and nickel/titanium alloy products for use in the aerospace &amp; defense, automotive, medical, oil &amp; gas, and construction markets.
