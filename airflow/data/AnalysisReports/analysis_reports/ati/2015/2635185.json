The stock had started gaining some momentum in February this year, but its inconsistent results have weighed on the stock's performance. For instance, the company has missed the Street's earnings estimate by an <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=ATI+Analyst+Estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\">average</a> of 96% over the last four quarters.</p> <p><b>Getting better</b></p> <p>However, it looks like Allegheny is gradually making some progress. The company's revenue in the third quarter had <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ati-announces-third-quarter-2014-111500152.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">improved</a> 10% on a year-over-year basis, while its losses also dropped. In fact, Allegheny managed to achieve break-even in the previous quarter as compared to a loss of $28.4 million in the prior-year period. Moreover, a turnaround can be expected at Allegheny since the company is working to strengthen its business.</p> <p>For example, the company's Hot-Rolling and Processing Facility, or HRPF, in which it had <a href=\"https://www.atimetals.com/businesses/ATIFlatRolledProducts/About/Pages/HRPF.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">invested</a> $1.2 billion, is performing ahead of expectations as far as the early quality of the product generated is concerned. Also, the quality of its Utah, Rowley Titanium Sponge facility is in line with industry standards.</p> <p><b>Key agreements to power the turnaround</b></p> <p>Driven by the robust quality of its products, Allegheny has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ati-reaches-mill-products-forgings-201800772.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">managed to land</a> three key strategic agreements, or LTAs, securing notable business for its forgings, mill products, and investment castings on superior and inherited single-aisle jet engines. Allegheny is continuously ramping up production for this material shift in the jet engine market with product innovation, acquisitions, and capital investments. Moreover, Allegheny has also received strong orders for its nickel-based alloy plate in its flat-rolled products business. This is expected to be used in a major oil and gas pipeline in Asia.</p> <p>The LTA also comprises of closed-die forgings, which include parts manufactured through sophisticated hot-die forging and iso-thermal processes.</p> <p>The company is also making investments in next-generation<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> alloys, components, and parts that are expected to expand at a faster rate than the growth of the aerospace market. These investments are on track to deliver robust shareholder value, driven by solid demand for Allegheny's differentiated and diversified products that are </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2580095-allegheny-technologies-ati-ceo-rich-harshman-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">expected</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to considerably outweigh the worldwide GDP growth for the coming 3 to 5 years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company is also seeing strong growth in titanium alloys, driven by robust customer demand for titanium ingots. In addition, titanium investment castings are also seeing growth, driven by Allegheny's <a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/allegheny-technologies-to-acquire-ladish-for-778-million/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition</a> of Ladish in 2011. As a result, Allegheny's revenue from casted products has doubled since the acquisition, and the company expects the trend to continue in the next five years as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Allegheny has also signed a number of agreements to improve its production and technological capability, along with customer contracts. For example, it has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2580095-allegheny-technologies-ati-ceo-rich-harshman-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\">signed</a> some active mill product contracts for differentiated alloys like ATI 718Plus alloy and Rene 65 alloy. An additional LTA has been signed with a key jet engine OEM that will enhance its forgings content on single-aisle aircrafts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>Aerospace prospects and a key acquisition</b></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, Allegheny is optimistic about growth in the aerospace segment. For example, it cites that Boeing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) is <a href=\"https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2014-10-02-Boeing-to-Increase-737-Production-Rate-to-52-per-Month-in-2018\" rel=\"nofollow\">planning</a> to enhance the production rates of 737 to 52 airplanes per month in 2018 from the present run rate of 42 planes. Additionally, Airbus is also expected to accelerate its development in order to counter Boeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Apart from the aerospace business, Allegheny is also focusing on its assortment of gas and oil products. Also, the company is continuing to expand its product offerings for gas and oil chemical processes. As such, the company had <a href=\"https://www.atimetals.com/news/Pages/NA_1898384.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquired</a> Flowform earlier this year in order to add cutting-edge products to its portfolio. This acquisition is expected to add strength to Allegheny's product line-up, driven by Flowform's technological expertise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">According to a <a href=\"https://ir.atimetals.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98187&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1898384\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>, \"uses a precision flowforming process to produce thin-walled components in net or near-net shapes across multiple alloy systems, including nickel-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, and specialty and stainless alloys.\" Moreover, Flowform primarily targets the aerospace, oil and gas, and the chemical process industries, which is why it should turn out to be a good fit for Allegheny's business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><b>A turnaround is expected</b></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Allegheny's latest results show that the company is in turnaround mode. Given the strategies that it is adopting and the agreements that it has entered into, it is likely that its performance will continue improving in the future. Allegheny was able to erase its losses last quarter, and analysts expect the trend to continue. It is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=ATI+Analyst+Estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated</a> that Allegheny's bottom line will increase at a CAGR of 15% for the next five years, better than the CAGR of 10% recorded in the last five years. Hence, Allegheny looks like a strong turnaround candidate that investors should not ignore.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Why Allegheny Technologies Is Set For A Turnaround. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2635185-why-allegheny-technologies-is-set-for-a-turnaround?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "56382", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "144252", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "114062", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2635185-why-allegheny-technologies-is-set-for-a-turnaround", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2635185-why-allegheny-technologies-is-set-for-a-turnaround", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "56382", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "anup-singh", "userId": 17356292, "tagId": 114062, "bio": "Anup Singh spends the majority of his time reading about companies.
