Market estimates include FCF growth from $66 million in 2022 to $391 million in 2024. Most analysts are also expecting double-digit ROE and a significant reduction in the net debt/EBITDA ratio.

Investors also expect an EBITDA margin around 15% and median operating margin close to 9%. Finally, it is also worth noting that the net margin will likely remain at close to 8% in 2023 and 2024.

Keep in mind that 2021 R&amp;D expenses increased as compared to that in 2020. Products with better performance and more efficiency will most likely be appreciated by customers. Hence, I would expect further revenue generation. Let's also keep in mind that ATI did generate hundreds of patents in the United States. New patents would also increase the company's know-how and recognition in the industry:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <p>ATI's metallic powder technology delivers alloy compositions and refined microstructures that offer increased performance and longer useful lives in high-temperature aerospace environments, as well as improves the efficiency of jet engines.</p> <p>We own hundreds of United States patents, many of which are also filed under the patent laws of other nations.

ATI reports a significant number of long-term agreements, which offer a lot of visibility to financial forecasters like me.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The Company maintained a backlog of confirmed orders totaling $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Also, with an EBITDA margin around 13% and 17%, I obtained 2033 EBITDA of $948 million. Finally, with an effective tax close to 22%, 2033 NOPAT would be close to $584 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I believe that changes in working capital around $94 million and $163 million would make sense. With capex/sales close to 4%-5% and growing D&amp;A, the free cash flow could reach $322 million if we are conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2022/9/12/saupload_VM8eXKsQZ5QG_Pm0TJEcmjMseJKIu7Xtq2AY_jE8A0Uwyor_fySCEgIdiJ5-NzmiFddDDqRE7-HhBcwJSHzBu3SQr3ysOq4JmNLqq6uy6b7B8OesepcRnjZQbKLsZpi-9oyWQGpsa9Wpiov_kQFOhUX8ayqFO-uRWdS5q8VUNmLT5H3mjiyVSbZHXg_thumb1.png\" alt=\"Arie's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Arie's DCF Model</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, I believe that a weighted average <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ATI+wacc&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=LjQeY9OTFvuA9u8PlNiJ6AY&amp;iflsig=AJiK0e8AAAAAYx5CPrxtKNH0OFtm3Dgf1H226xCimWwG&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT4uH9uY36AhV7gP0HHRRsAm0Q4dUDCAc&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=ATI+wacc&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANQAFjdCGDACWgAcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAqABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz\" rel=\"nofollow\">cost of capital</a> of 7% would be higher than what most investors may use. The net present value of future FCF would be close to $2 billion. If we use an EV/2033 EBITDA of 6x and a net debt around $1.8 billion, the equity per share would stay at $42-$43 per share. ATI currently trades at more than 8x EBITDA, so by using this multiple, the equity per share would stand at $56 per share, and the IRR could stand at 4.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2022/9/12/saupload_Squi-dKLU8yp2-Mwa0Yhmu-2Bl6NkzgYUthbOWrMhalulGBl0oJp6jKwjF-rR0s7pzL-JDRqScMIqRH7RrL2sK_fIxtyIrN1n8SfiEHpyX4N-dj2kX2XuXHzmPkkoBzZcxUcUTwLWpZymu7QZMg8xZYOh4VG9JIzv5qH_7FEpALyg-Mmp8yzH5W-bQ_thumb1.png\" alt=\"Arie's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Arie's DCF Model</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks From Low Demand, Detrimental Conditions In The Aerospace Industry, And Detrimental Relationship With Suppliers Imply A Valuation Of $25 Per Share</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ATI could suffer from cyclical changes in demand driven by consumption changes. Besides, international overcapacity, decreases in the price of substitute materials, or changes in the price of raw materials could drive profitability down. In the worst-case scenario, ATI shareholders may suffer a decline in the free cash flow expectations, which may push the stock valuation down:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers' products due to economic downturns. Other factors that may cause fluctuation in our customers' positions are changes in market demand, lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity, currency fluctuations, lower priced imports and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials. Source: 10-K</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ATI also has significant exposure to the aerospace industry, which is also quite cyclical. In my view, changes in the economic conditions, changes in the fuel price, new COVID-19 outbreaks, or any other risk would affect ATI:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The commercial aerospace industry has historically been cyclical due to factors both external and internal to the airline industry. These factors include general economic conditions, airline profitability, consumer demand for air travel, varying fuel and labor costs. Source: 10-K</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Under very adverse conditions, I expect issues with suppliers of nickel and chromium. The fact that the company obtains a lot of such metals from Russia is worrying. Considering the invasion of Ukraine, the United States may not facilitate trade with Russia. As a result, perhaps ATI may have to work with other suppliers, which may damage the company's free cash flow margin.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>For example, we source both nickel and chromium from Russian sources that could be impacted by current events involving Russia and the Ukraine and any U.S. or other international economic sanctions or other actions in response. These or similar conditions may disrupt supplies or affect the prices of the materials that are necessary to our operations.

With small growth from 2026 to 2033, 2033 net sales would stand at almost $4.5 billion. With an EBITDA margin around 15% and effective tax of 22%, 2033 NOPAT would be $375 million. I also assumed changes in working capital/sales of 2.5% and capex/sales of 5%. The results would include 2023 FCF of $215 million and 2033 FCF close to $220 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2022/9/12/saupload_WlwZmlEaAPr-kYUTN2kb3WlbDiesyL9ZGo-J_HX3TrdJw0Trt8gZ2zLybJ6VN7GxdSABNE9Vl-ETJ8wiNcQHZfE4Vy9GbFNSA0I4SjxxfBtcsV7pGoT1yalSwfY1xwqziEXHewNFao2EFev97dqyG534hOWbnhCDntPn0cy4_m5r4gtnmRrzfB1Qbw_thumb1.png\" alt=\"Arie's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Arie's DCF Model</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, if we use a discount of 7.5%, which is higher than that in the previous case scenario, the net present value would be close to $1.5 billion.

Besides, if ATI does not lose its connections with large and established conglomerates in the aerospace industry, sales growth may remain stable. In my opinion, the market didn't take into account future free cash flow and estimates from financial analysts. Under a DCF model with a very conservative discount rate and conservative sales growth, ATI could be worth $56 per share.
