I believe being on the short side makes a lot more sense than being on the long side.</p> <h3><strong>Earnings</strong></h3> <p>On a trailing twelve months (TTM) basis, the company generated $3,638.2m in revenue, with positive EBIT of $108.5m.</p> <p>As you can see in the table below, revenues have grown at a negative rate over the past five years (-1.92% per annum, compounded, vs. an average negative growth rate of -3.60%). This growth has been largely stable.</p> <p><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286348659401524_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"751\" data-height=\"287\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286348659401524.png\" alt=\"ATI Earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"245\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>The company's sales are both declining on average and trending downward over time.</p> <p>Gross profits vs. total assets help to adjust for less meaningful fluctuations or trends in revenues. It is useful for \u201cnormalizing\u201d any top-line changes. As the table above shows, the gross profit vs. total assets ratio has increased over time (currently: 9.06%). Gross profits are firmly rising relative to total assets. This is obviously a good thing. However, as you can see, gross profits are not translating into positive net income.</p> <p>In nominal terms, gross profits have risen over the five-year period (by 16.88% compounded). However, gross profits have been about 15x as volatile as revenues (considerably more volatile). Averages and compound growth rates are useless in the broader context of this unpredictable and fundamentally bad business.</p> <p>Allegheny Technologies' gross<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> margin was 13.33% in the past twelve months, versus an average of 7.20% in the past five years inclusive. Again, this is positive in relation to gross profits, but not enough in the broader scheme of things.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), i.e. Operating Income, was +$108.5m in the past twelve months, which represents an EBIT margin of 2.98%. Generally speaking, Allegheny Technologies' EBIT margin has strengthened over recent years. However, the sustainability of its more recently positive EBIT margin is suspect. (This more recent margin compares to an average five-year margin of -5.13%.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's net income was -$51.40m in the recent TTM period (a net margin of -1.41%). Allegheny Technologies' net margin trend has worsened over the past five years, despite the increasing gross profits/margins. And clearly, even in positive years, the company's net margin is tight relative to revenues. Its FCF margin meanwhile, as discussed later, has been negative in the past five annual periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, it is worth considering Allegheny Technologies' sales, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, and operating leverage; the ability of the company to generate operating earnings from sales and gross profits. I have measured this over time by examining the change in Operating Income/EBIT vs. the change in sales and gross profits individually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286354851058848_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"751\" data-height=\"353\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286354851058848.png\" alt=\"ATI Operating Leverage\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"301\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Note: I have \u201cwinsorized\u201d the data to calculate the final averages for my three measures of operating leverage, which is to say I have removed large fluctuations/anomalies.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As the table shows, the company's EBIT fluctuates significantly relative to sales and gross profits - so much so that it is difficult to establish Allegheny Technologies' underlying leverage. If I did not exclude larger variations/anomalies though, average operating leverage wouldn't have looked much different.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Basically, if sales are ever materially adversely affected by general business conditions, the EBIT crashes through the floor. That is in spite of the fact that SG&amp;A vs. sales being consistently under 8%. The reason is down to the lower gross margin, which, even in more receptive business conditions, has not been enough to create sustainable, positive earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The table above also shows that Sales, General &amp; Administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses have generally increased, relative to sales, over the past five years, albeit marginally. Relative to gross profits, SG&amp;A expenses have conversely decreased, as the gross margin has measurably improved. But gross margins are unlikely to hold up over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Allegheny Technologies has historically paid dividends. However, the dividend yield is currently 0%, based on no dividends being paid in the past twelve months (with TTM net income of -$51.40m).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Quality of Earnings and Cash Flow</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition to negative net income, operating cash flows have fallen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the most recent TTM period, operating cash flows were $85.50m (vs. net income of -$51.40m). Over the past five years, operating cash flow has consistently exceeded net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, the company spends a lot on capital expenditures, due to the nature of its capital-intensive business. Free cash flow, then, has been negative in the past five years and lower than net income in three of the past five years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the table below, you can see the long-term relationship between Allegheny Technologies' operating cash flow vs. net income (which includes net income to non-controlling interests) over the long term. The so-called income quality ratio is less useful in this case, given the negative figures that distort the ratio from year to year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-1528636310741684_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1236\" data-height=\"111\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-1528636310741684.png\" alt=\"ATI Operating Cash Flows vs. Net Income\" width=\"640\" height=\"57\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"57\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past three years, net income sums to a massively negative $1.1 billion, while operating cash flow is a more forgiving (positive) +$51 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Free cash flow (FCF) can be simplistically calculated as operating cash flow minus net business capital expenditures. Allegheny Technologies' five-year average FCF is -$144m. Its FCF is becoming less negative over time, but it is still indeed negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286365029226208_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"751\" data-height=\"177\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286365029226208.png\" alt=\"ATI Free Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"151\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"151\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>The table above also shows the company's FCF margins, which have been steadily negative over the past five years (TTM: -1.48%, and -1.01% relative to total assets). Given the company's negative net income, free cash flow is an important metric for Allegheny Technologies, not just for business purposes but also for investors/valuation purposes. Yet, it is even more consistently negative than net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Next, we will briefly examine the company's cash conversion cycle to help assess the quality and sustainability of earnings and cash flow.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Cash Conversion Cycle</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the past TTM period, the full cash conversion cycle (CCC) has fallen from 149 days (in the prior TTM period) to 142 days (calculated for March 2018 as: DSO of 56 + DIO of 131 - DPO of 45). Further, over the past five years (a longer time horizon), Allegheny Technologies' CCC has fallen, which is generally a positive sign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286366198770738_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"751\" data-height=\"133\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286366198770738.png\" alt=\"ATI Cash Conversion Cycle\" width=\"640\" height=\"113\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"113\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>The company's TTM CCC was 153 days in March 2014 and was as low as 136 days in the TTM period ending March 2015. Over the five-year period, days sales outstanding have generally fallen, days inventory outstanding have trended downward, and days payables outstanding have generally fallen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, though, the cash conversion cycle has improved. There is nothing bad to report here. Also, as shown in the table below, finished goods at still getting shifted on average within 20 days:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286369372704308.png\" alt=\"ATI Inventories Composition\" width=\"552\" height=\"419\" data-width=\"552\" data-height=\"419\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finished goods as a percentage of total inventories are trending upwards though, which is generally not a propitious sign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">(Note: in the table above, days inventory outstanding differs to the same measure in the preceding cash conversion cycle table, as this version is on a current-cost basis, not LIFO, and also does not adjust for inventory valuation reserves or progress payments.)</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Financial Health and Risk</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Firstly, the company's return on assets (ROA) is negative, which is not good (note: ROA increased year over year). The company's gross margin has increased, however, which is positive (13.3% vs. 9.9%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating cash flow was positive in the trailing twelve months, which is obviously good in light of its negative net income. By virtue of its negative net income, operating cash flow exceeded net income in the trailing twelve months too (a good sign).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Further, leverage (debts) fell in the recent period (a positive sign). The company's current ratio increased, which could be interpreted positively. The company's shares increased (generally not a positive sign). And finally, the company's asset turnover ratio (sales vs. average total assets) increased in the recent period (a positive sign).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These factors are considered in Piotroski's F-score, a test for financial health. A score of 9 is perfect; 0 is the worst possible score. Allegheny Technologies' F-score is 7, which is considered good. This has improved noticeably since the prior TTM period, in which the F-score for Allegheny Technologies was 4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, due to the variability of Allegheny's sales, cash flows, and earnings, and given its consistently negative free cash flow, I would not attribute much significance or credibility to this formulaic approach to assessing financial health.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company's debt-to-capital ratio is 46.41%, while the company's EBIT-to-net-interest-expense ratio was 0.86x in the trailing twelve months (this has improved over the past five years, in that it has been negative in three of the past five years).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although the company's debt load is not too high, it appears that the company's debt load is most likely unsustainable, and further dilution of equity will be needed to satisfy these financial obligations. (The weighted average share count in the recent quarter ending in March 2018 was over 15% higher on a year-over-year basis, due to a recent equity offering.)</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Balance Sheet</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The funding of Allegheny Technologies' assets is comprised of 63% of liabilities and 37% of equity (total assets minus total liabilities). As noted, the company's debt/capital ratio is 46.41% (that is, financial debts vs. the sum of financial debts plus shareholders' equity).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company is therefore using a considerable amount of leverage. As shown in the table below, the company's leverage has increased over recent years, while its interest coverage has improved (0.9x in the most recent TTM period ended 31 March 2018). However, its interest coverage ratio is still less than 1x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286375646980188_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1236\" data-height=\"133\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-15286375646980188.png\" alt=\"ATI Leverage Table\" width=\"640\" height=\"69\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"69\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span>At this point, it is starting to look like the face value of the company's debt is converging on the value of the enterprise as a whole.

My assumption for Allegheny Technologies' compound annual growth rate for the next five years is simply zero; 0%. I am using the same growth rate of 0% for long-term growth to perpetuity. This may or may not be generous, in light of falling sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">My second assumption is that the company's target 10-year EBIT margin gradually moves from its current EBIT margin of 2.98% to 5.00% over the next 10 years. A consistent EBIT margin of +5% would be generous, given the margin has been negative in three of the past five years, with its highest margin being in the period ended March 2015 (at +3.4%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am also giving the company a base discount rate of 8.00%, and I am using the same rate for the terminal value in year 10. I believe 8% is generous for a company that is free cash flow negative, with declining sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All said, this provides us with an enterprise value of $1,893.05m. After adjusting for cash, debt, etc., we find an equity value of $286.75m (or $2.28 per share), which represents -92% downside from the current share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">If I give the company a long-term growth rate of 2%, 3% sales growth over the next five years, and keep the target EBIT margin target and discount rates the same as above, projected downside is still 90%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Moving Averages (MAs)</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From a simple, technical perspective, stocks whose 20/200 MAs and 50/200 MAs are both above 1.00x, and whose 20/200 MAs exceed their 50/200 MAs, are thought to be in upward trends. If a stock's 20/200 and 50/200 MAs are both negative, and the more recent 20/200 MA is below the 50/200 MA, a stock is thought to be in a downward trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Allegheny Technologies' its 20-day moving average vs. its 200-day moving average is 1.12, while the stock's 50-day moving average vs. its 200-day moving average is 1.07.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-1528638142446605_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"869\" data-height=\"431\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/10/40530335-1528638142446605.png\" alt=\"ATI Moving Averages\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span>Currently, ATI stock appears to be in an upward trend.
