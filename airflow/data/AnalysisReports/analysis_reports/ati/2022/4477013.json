I wrote about it way back in 2017 before the stock went on a large run after successfully completing its transition<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> into high value aerospace manufacturing and in December of 2019 prior to the COVID pandemic. However, back in March of 2020 the thesis for ATI changed with the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic. The company was forced to take on significant debts in order to ride out the storm and its earnings have still yet to recover to their pre pandemic highs. This has thrown into question the possibility of continued future growth and how profitable the company will be going into the future. Several factors outside of the company's own control will play a large role going forward in how investors' returns will look moving forward. I bought into the company with the onset of COVID when it was very low but sold earlier this year with the increase in the sector primarily to fund the purchase of my first house, but I still find myself looking at ATI and wondering what the future holds for this company and how this will affect common stock investors.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><strong>The COVID Debt Hangover</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As several in the sector had to do to remain afloat ATI took on a lot of debt in order to make it through the pandemic. Now, the company is sitting on nearly 1.8 billion dollars in debt which is a pretty scary figure considering it was only bringing in little over 250 million in profits in 2019. All this additional debt brings with it an interest expense for the company annually that costs around 100 million dollars. Although I am extremely confident that the company will be able to at least be able to meet their debt obligations given what they should have available in free cash flow it does seriously beg the question as to if there will be a significant amount of profits left over for shareholders to really see a great return. In my 2019 article, I was looking forward to the company giving money back to shareholders through share buybacks and maybe even a reinstatement of the dividend, but that is definitely out of the question for at least a few more years. This debt, although manageable, will be a significant weight on the company moving forward and should certainly be considered by perspective investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><strong>Future Growth and Profits</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The key for the company to get over all the headwinds it is facing is more growth and more profits. Just getting back to the level the company was at pre-COVID will not allow this company to perform better than the broad market. Where will these come from? Jet engines are still stuttering as the world starts to hesitantly return to the skies, and the problems from Boeing's airplanes weigh on ATI\u2019s results. However if aerospace recovers it can be huge for ATI. There are loads of planes that need to be upgraded to the new generation engines that ATI manufactures. Aside from the aerospace impacts on the company they are seeing increased demand for titanium from Industrial operations that are expected to continue to perform well moving forward. This along with the business from power generation, and defense should all experience solid growth in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company expects to spend around 200 million in capex every year moving forward. About 90 million of that is to be maintenance capex, but the rest is to be deployed to help grow the company's businesses. Pre-COVID ATI did a good job deploying capital after its transition out of commodity steel products and revenues and profit margins were expanding. Assuming management can keep these solid results as they reinvest capital into the future the company could see significant expansion over the 2019 levels going into the next few years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><strong>Valuation &amp; Discount From Pre Pandemic Prices</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Currently the company trades at around $15 a share. Which is a greater than 40% discount from the companies pre pandemic highs. This ends up being a nearly 2 billion dollar loss in market cap for the company compared to pre COVID. As mentioned earlier in the article, the company took on significant debt during the pandemic but not nearly as much as was loss in market cap from the company. This means that investors are likely pricing in some permanent negative impact to the company's business. I do believe the ATI will reach its pre pandemic levels of profits however the timeline for that is likely two years plus. However for someone who is very patient this steep discount could allow for outsized returns into the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><strong>The Investment Thesis</strong></span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ATI, as with most aerospace related companies, is surrounded in uncertainty as to what future profits will look like. In the short term, I don't see there being a lot of upside available to equity holders. With the debt overhang and a challenging environment, most of the profits the company generates will likely be thrown at paying back debt and at capex within the company. However, as this debt gets paid down, the company continues to reduce its pension obligations, and the business recovers/grows, there could be an opportunity here. COVID has likely set the company's plan backwards by a few years. However, at the discount it currently trades at, and with the assumption that management will find ways to continue to grow the business in the future. A very long term investor could start thinking about building a position in ATI. If I was entering into this, I would probably approach it by averaging over the course of several months given the general volatility in aerospace at the moment. Very long term I am bullish on ATI, but if you are looking for a high probability of outsized performance in the next two years, ATI is probably not the best stock for this moment. So in short, only get into ATI if you want to be here for a long time.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Allegheny Technologies: Long Time Horizon Required. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477013-allegheny-technologies-long-time-horizon-required?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "102723", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "354581", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "572286", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4477013-allegheny-technologies-long-time-horizon-required", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477013-allegheny-technologies-long-time-horizon-required", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1222636238/image_1222636238.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "schemaImage": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1222636238/image_1222636238.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1222636238/image_1222636238.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9", "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1222636238/image_1222636238.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3"]}}, "included": [{"id": "102723", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "industrious-investor", "userId": 48032762, "tagId": 572286, "bio": "<p>Mechanical Engineer that likes to write about stocks in my spare time!
