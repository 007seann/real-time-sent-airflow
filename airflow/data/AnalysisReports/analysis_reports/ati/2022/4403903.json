There were little signs of improvement in its key end-markets that could promise quick sales recovery, namely in commercial aerospace, but 2021 looked much brighter, as the vaccines instilled confidence that restrictions would be eased and the air travel would eventually recover.</p> <p>Thankfully, I was right, as since then, the stock price has risen by ~37.9%, largely outpacing the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR\u00ae S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) that has advanced by only ~9%. The total return here does not make sense, as ATI does not pay a dividend.</p> <p>So, is it time to take profit? Let us delve deeper into the Q4 results first.</p> <h4><strong>The top line: aerospace still suffering</strong></h4> <p>Upon cursory inspection, the Q4 results look utterly lackluster. Though the global economy was slowly recuperating, for ATI, the quarter appeared to be one of the toughest periods of the challenging year, only slightly less severe than Q3. The <em>High Performance Materials &amp; Components</em><strong> </strong>segment bore the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> brunt, as its sales tumbled much deeper if compared to </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Advanced Alloys &amp; Solutions,</em><strong class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">by over 55%. The division also coped with a much steeper compression of the EBITDA margin, to just 3.4% from 18.7%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Q4 total revenues <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATI/income-statement#figure_type=quarterly#view_type=yoy_growth\">were down</a> by <em>35.4%,</em> which looks only marginally better than in Q3, which was overshadowed by an over 41% decline. Its revenues did rise sequentially, which is certainly an inspiring development, but they were still not even near the 4Q19 level of $1.02 billion. The same applies to the results for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The main culprit of this was the <em>asymmetric recovery</em> in its end-markets. In the fourth quarter, most of Allegheny's end-markets continued experiencing the ripple effects of the coronavirus crisis, but while some were enjoying high demand, like the non-cyclical <em>defense</em> industry and <em>electronics</em>, some were navigating rough waters as customers were still unwilling to boost inventory, as they remained skeptical about the short-term demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Aerospace </em>(Jet Engine and Airframe), the essential end-market responsible for 34% of the 2020 sales (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/14646580.pdf\">page 10</a>), suffered from even deeper revenue contraction than in Q3. While total segmental sales were down by 64%, the quarter appeared especially dreadful for Jet Engine, as its revenues plummeted by 72% to $82 million. On <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/871/64871/original.pdf\">slide 6</a>, ATI clarified that it happened partly due to <em>\"destocking from specialty materials\u2019 customers,</em>\" though also highlighted <em>\"demand stabilizing.\" </em>Meanwhile, Airframe encountered akin problems as customers were struggling to reduce excessive inventory; so, sales plunged 49%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Is the end-market critical to Allegheny's revenues about to shine again? Unfortunately, there is almost no hope that the recovery will begin earlier than in the second half of 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The vaccines are improving the overall outlook for the global economy, but for airlines, 2021 will likely remain full of challenges. For example, one of Allegheny's essential customers Rolls-Royce Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYCEF\" title=\"Rolls-Royce Holdings plc\">OTCPK:RYCEF</a>), a British aero-engine maker, has recently warned investors that its cash outflow in 2021 would be more substantial than previously guided. The firm thinks it will burn more than \u00a32 billion (<a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/rolls-royce-stock-tumbles-as-jet-engine-maker-warns-on-2-7-billion-cash-outflow-amid-new-covid-strains-51611667086\" rel=\"nofollow\">~$2.7 billion</a>), as more contagious variants of the coronavirus will restrain global air travel. The company <a href=\"https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/investors/rr-trading-update-jan-2021.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">is expecting</a> engine flying hours in 2021 to be ~55% of the pre-coronavirus level vs. 70% anticipated in October. As customers pay Rolls-Royce for the number of hours its jet engines fly, it will take its toll on the top line and cash flows. This, in turn, implies that revenues of ATI's Jet Engine will remain subpar (or there might emerge a receivables problem if Rolls-Royce will encounter severe liquidity issues).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It is also worth highlighting that GE Aviation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE\" title=\"General Electric Company\">GE</a>), another major customer of Allegheny, has recently reported that its 2020 engine sales plunged 48%, while service revenue fell 36%. But though the 2020 results were horrible, the company remains somewhat optimistic, predicting the aerospace sector to enter the recovery phase <em>in the second half of 2021</em><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/693/64693/original.pdf\">slide 9</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Allegheny's forecast chimes well with the expectations of its customers. As it clarified on <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/871/64871/original.pdf\">slide 9</a>, the demand from the end-market would stabilize in the first half of the year and then enter the <em>\"modest growth\"</em> phase in H2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Another issue that weighed on the Q4 and 2020 results of the company was sapping demand from the energy sector (including oil &amp; gas and chemical processing). The capex reduction trend triggered by the oil crisis in spring was still in play despite the quick Brent price recovery. The silver lining is that the remarkable growth in <em>defense </em>(+18% QoQ) and <em>electronics </em>(+27% QoQ) again somewhat mitigated the effects of softness in the aerospace, medical, and energy end-markets on the top line.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The positives: focus on cash flows</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But what happened with profits? Certainly, lackluster sales and the compression of the gross margin were among the culprits of the catastrophic loss, but the principal issue is that in Q4, Allegheny booked restructuring expenses of over $1 billion mostly related to the operations in Brackenridge, PA. The rationale behind the move, which was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3640800-allegheny-tech-to-exit-standard-stainless-sheet-products\">announced</a> in December, was to improve the company's profitability by exiting the low-margin standard stainless steel business and focus on high-value materials (like nickel- and titanium-based alloys) to bolster profitability and Return on Capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But as a scrupulous investor will notice, almost all restructuring expenses during the period were non-cash, and thus they were added back to net income to arrive at the net operating cash flow. These costs also did no harm to both adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. So, Allegheny reported the 2020 net CFFO of almost $167 million, which excessively covered net capital expenditures of $130.6 million (see page 9 of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/14646580.pdf\">the Form 8-K</a>). Of course, a $36.3 million cash surplus is meager, but it is still a result worth appreciating given the magnitude of the crisis ATI had to cope with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a side note, investors should not overlook that ATI's definition of FCF differs from one typically used in equity research: it deducts cash used in investing activities from net CFFO and adds back<em> cash contributions to the U.S. qualified defined pension plans </em>(see the reconciliation on <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/871/64871/original.pdf\">slide 14</a>). In this case, its 2020 FCF reached $168.4 million, which was above guidance.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ATI's rich price gains in late-2020 is a perfect example of how a value stock can trounce the market when growth names look too generously valued and no longer attractive, thus money goes to cyclical players.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/5/49647006-16125358558972595_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1462\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/5/49647006-16125358558972595.png\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"222\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">But due to this rally, and also because of EBITDA compression, ATI's EV/EBITDA is now at a three-year high of over 17x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/5/49647006-161253591269959_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1462\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/2/5/49647006-161253591269959.png\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"222\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkdin=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I am now neutral on ATI, but my downgrade has nothing to do with its horrible accounting loss.
