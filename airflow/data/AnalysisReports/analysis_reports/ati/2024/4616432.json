Revenue of $87.05M beat by nearly 22% Y/Y, and EPS of $0.17 beat by $0.03. I included OPRA Stock as one of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613733-top-10-tech-stocks-for-2h-2023\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613733-top-10-tech-stocks-for-2h-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Tech Stocks</a> for the second half of 2023. Opera\u2019s adjusted EBITDA of $21.7M, a 25% margin, and year-over-year EBIT growth showcasing a +17,900% difference to the sector makes clear the company is on the right track. Partnering with YouTube for an influencer campaign to launch live scoring for football, OPRA\u2019s already large user base received an added push after the YouTube launch surpassed 50 million users in less than six months, highlighting Opera\u2019s distribution strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">AI is becoming a must-have for companies, and Opera is capitalizing. As expressed by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4597276-opera-limited-opra-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4597276-opera-limited-opra-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Co-CEO Song Lin</a>,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>\"Year-to-date, integration of the AI services has become a top priority for many popular consumer apps, and we set out to be among leaders within browsers and AI.

Despite an overall \u2018D\u2019 valuation grade, Opera offers some discounted valuation metrics. OPRA\u2019s Price/Book ratios are a difference of 15.06% (TTM) and 33.02% (FWD) compared to the sector. While the stock trades near its 52-week high, the tech sector has been rallying in 2023, and this stock has a forward EPS growth rate of 154%, more than justifying the valuation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/11/saupload_p89fvTsFfrQT7qWqyP6NkfeZLfduOVZQ9nw_4viHIvlqHyBRoZhD3YIIqNVcEHOD8jgvWHWBY0MqLEZMldzraX-6Vk85-zK2qFFU-Xbp5A0aCAeBONeHimDcgC_ro4Mqv3fE3vCcBpyoovGKkZAuCig.png\" alt=\"OPRA Stock Momentum Grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OPRA Stock Momentum Grade <span>(SA Premium)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">OPRAs momentum demonstrates excellent quarterly price performance compared to the sector. And like my two previous growth stocks, it demonstrates rapid revenue and earnings per share growth. With revenue estimates expected to climb, consider the big opportunity posed by each growth stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>OPRA revenue estimates are expected to climb</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2023/7/11/saupload_Vt9YWG5bT7dKUKnvOZ3fpP6w6iaeGKcUaAKAcscpbJMqgn08BPa058ciluvfAtunBBzP68DAlUD0ECCZUtQyj-EfjOdC4S8popdiB53VHo9CGJINRk0iRidDvUdSJWHmVNmAMQDgFjSDJHW3paAX8g4.png\" alt=\"OPRA revenue estimates chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OPRA revenue estimates are expected to climb <span>(SA Premium)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The latest earnings for CPA, ATI, and OPRA were impressive and supported their growth prospects. The economic outlook is still uncertain, which poses risks. So, consider the risks to growth stocks while reviewing the quant ratings and factor grades supporting my fundamentally strong picks. Here are the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed041-Top-Application-Software-Stocks\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed041-Top-Application-Software-Stocks\" target=\"_blank\">Top Application Software Stocks</a> if you would like to explore different Quant Strong Buy recommendations in the Software Industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks: Growth Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Growth stocks come with inherent risks, including higher volatility. Because growth stocks do not typically offer dividends, investors hope for upside to earn money so that they can sell shares of the stock. If a company performs poorly, investors take a loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Because many growth stocks trade at premium valuations, they can be more susceptible to price swings. Additionally, given the inflationary and high-interest rate environment, high-growth companies looking to borrow money are more likely to take a hit in terms of expensive borrowing costs. Factor in the banking crisis and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/banks-face-higher-capital-requirements-in-plan-from-fed-s-barr?srnd=premium\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/banks-face-higher-capital-requirements-in-plan-from-fed-s-barr?srnd=premium\" target=\"_blank\">regulatory overhauls</a> tightening lending practices, and newer and smaller growth companies could face greater difficulties in turning a profit and growing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Growth stocks rated Strong Buys can offer a great opportunity to capture the upside. All three growth stocks have forward EPS growth rates above 150%, and they significantly surpass the growth rates of the Mega-tech stocks and offer valuation frameworks that are more attractive than the Mega-tech stocks. The investment fundamentals on these stocks are excellent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the heels of the markets rallying, growth stocks that have fallen in price may offer upside. Although many growth stocks continue to decline, CPA, ATI, and OPRA are great considerations for long-term investors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Although growth stocks pose some inherent risks in a recessionary environment, and volatility still exists, each stock offers tremendous growth with some of the fastest revenue and earnings per share growth in their respective sectors and bullish momentum in diversified industries. Wall Street analysts have also favored these three top growth stocks and have been revising their earnings estimates. The Wall Street analysts covering these stocks indicate that results will be better than expected, giving way to the next running of the bulls.
