ATI can experience a strong growth over the next 3 to 5 years as it is believed that the market conditions will favor ATI's operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Management's successful efficiency in reducing unessential costs</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the short-term, ATI continues to concentrate on issues which are within its control. The priority lies in reduction of cost. The company is keen on cost reduction efforts, which has resulted in a gross <a href=\"https://ir.atimetals.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98187&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1840413&amp;highlight=\" rel=\"nofollow\">cost reduction of $79 million</a> and above for the 1H13. These cost reductions will surely benefit ATI's operations for the current year and several years to come. ATI is focused on reducing and managing working capital through various actions, which includes priority based initiatives to improve inventory turns. It was successful in reducing the managed working capital by $48 million in 2Q13 versus 1Q13, and was reduced to 39.8% of annualized sales at the end of June 2013 from 41.1% at year-end 2012.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>ATI keen to treat its shareholder paying quarterly dividends</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite a huge cap-ex to be incurred for the year, ATI is focused on treating its shareholders with regular cash dividends. Recently, on Aug. 2, 2013, ATI announced that its Board of Directors has declared a regular cash dividend of $0.18 per share for 2Q13. The record date is Aug. 21, 2013 for the stockholders who are entitled to receive the dividend payment on September 18, 2013. Earlier this year, ATI has paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share on June 19, 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These secular growth markets are not dependent upon strong short-term GDP growth cycles in any one economy. Rather, the markets are responding to a long-term demographic shift, and the long-term infrastructure building and rebuilding occurring on a global basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ATI has following strategies and future outlook:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Capital Investments and Strategic Acquisitions</li> <li>Lucrative growth in commercial aerospace market</li> <li>Cost Reduction</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Change in Management ATI has a strategy to look beyond any short-term challenges and ensure it remains in a place for profitable growth within the foreseeable future.
