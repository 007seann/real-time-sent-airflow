It maintains a diverse product mix which includes titanium, nickel alloys, precision strip and exotic alloys. Although Allegany produces some commodity items such as stainless steel products, its focus and a significant portion of its profits are generated from innovative, specialty alloys that only a few companies in the world are able to produce.</p> <p><strong>It's Been a Tough Few Years:</strong></p> <p>Allegheny is a very cyclical stock as most of its end markets are tied to long cycle capital projects which ebb and flow with overall economic output. Its revenue peaked in 2007 at $5.5 billion, a high water mark it will not likely hit again until 2014 or 2015. Operating profit also peaked in 2007 at $1.3 billion, and considering its 2012 operating profit of $0.5 billion, the company likely has a long way to go to match its 2007 profitability.</p> <p>Not surprisingly given its poor performance over the last several years, Allegheny<span>'s</span> stock price has been on a free fall from a peak of about $117 in 2007 to its current price of about $27. The Company has also kept its dividend flat since 2008 at $0.72 a share, though at the current stock price, the dividend amounts to a 2.6% yield.</p> <p>While the recession clearly hurt Allegheny, it has not seen a strong recovery even in recent quarters. Its sales were down 3% in 2012 vs. 2011. Sales for 2Q13 were down 16% vs. 2Q12, and operating margin dropped 1.9%.</p> <p>Economic weakness, commodity prices and excess supply coupled with weak demand are the main culprits with regard to the challenges the company has faced the last several years. While these are concerns that will always exist for the company, I believe Allegheny is beginning to come</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Allegheny Technologies: Challenged In 2013, But Poised To Take Off From Aerospace Recovery. https://seekingalpha.com/article/1620772-allegheny-technologies-challenged-in-2013-but-poised-to-take-off-from-aerospace-recovery?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "51692", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "107012", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "103561", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/1620772-allegheny-technologies-challenged-in-2013-but-poised-to-take-off-from-aerospace-recovery", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/1620772-allegheny-technologies-challenged-in-2013-but-poised-to-take-off-from-aerospace-recovery", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/8/2157361-13759919628893318-Michael-Vellucci_origin.jpg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/8/2157361-13759919628893318-Michael-Vellucci_origin.jpg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "51692", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "michael-vellucci", "userId": 2157361, "tagId": 107012, "bio": "<p>The particular style of investing I like to focus on is dividend growth stock investing.
