Investors' faith in management has faltered, to put it kindly.</p> <p>In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3358785-after-sell-off-allegheny-technologies-incorporated-is-appropriately-priced-for-a-small-speculative-entry-position\">prior article</a> on ATI, back when Allegheny Technologies Incorporated was trading around $21 per share, I argued that \"ATI is now appropriately priced for a small, speculative-entry long position for speculative (non-value oriented) investors willing to take substantial risk and average down.\" Following a 32% decline since, I have once again bought more shares (this time at $14.15 per share), though I am keeping my portfolio weighting at &lt;2% as an acknowledgment of the inherent risks with this company.</p> <p>In this article, I outline my reasoning for buying more ATI today.</p> <p><strong>1) Alcoa (NYSE: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AA\" title=\"Alcoa Corporation\">AA</a>) <a href=\"https://www.alcoa.com/global/en/investment/info_page/two-strong-companies.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that it would split into two publicly-traded companies.</strong> One of the new companies will include Alcoa's higher-growth, \"value-add\" businesses tied to automotive/aerospace end-markets, while the other company would include Alcoa's lower-growth, commoditized (generously named \"upstream\") businesses. The stock rose 6% on the news.</p> <p>And it's understandable why. Like Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, Alcoa has seen its company-wide revenues and margins crushed by cheap foreign competition within its more commoditized businesses, mainly those that do not serve high specificity, high-growth end-markets like aerospace, automotive, and oil &amp; gas. So management has decided to separate out the businesses that serve high-growth end-markets -- businesses that also have growing profit margins -- in order to earn those businesses a higher valuation multiple.</p> <p>Always one to play along, Jim Kramer compared the new \"value-add\" business to industry-leader and recent Warren Buffett-targeted Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP) in a CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/28/alcoa-to-split-into-two-separate-publicly-traded-companies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">interview</a> today. And<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> that is exactly what Alcoa is seeking to achieve, as PCP is being bought by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">BRK.A</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">BRK.B</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) for a roughly 12x trailing EBITDA multiple.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>2) ATI's Higher Performance business is not too dissimilar from Alcoa's new \"value-add\" business.</strong> Sales to the aerospace/automotive end-markets for Alcoa's new \"value-add\" business are <a href=\"https://www.alcoa.com/two-strong-companies/pdf/Value-Add_Factsheet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">39%/7%</a>, compared to ATI's High Performance &gt;37%/&gt;8% exposure in 1H15 (ATI's total aerospace/automotive end-market exposure was 37%/8% in 1H15, and High Performance has higher aerospace/auto exposure than the Flat-Rolled Products business). EBITDA margins for the \"value-add\" business are <a href=\"https://www.alcoa.com/global/en/investment/pdfs/Alcoa%20Separation%20Presentation%20-%20with%20appendix.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">15%</a> (LTM 2015), compared to ATI High Performance 1H15 EBITDA margins of roughly 13%. Basically, the new Alcoa \"value-add\" company and ATI's High Performance segment are levered to growth in the same end-markets while sporting similar EBITDA margin profiles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>3) Applying a 12x EBITDA multiple to ATI's High Performance business generates an enterprise value greater than the company as a whole right now.</strong> Based on ATI's 2Q15 report, I estimate that 1H15 adjusted EBITDA for ATI's High Performance segment is roughly $135M, which equates to annualized adjusted EBITDA of $270M. Placing a 12x PCP-like multiple (supported by the 13x EBITDA multiple PCP paid for RTI International), values ATI's High Performance business at an enterprise value of $3.2B. Compare that valuation to ATI's Monday close enterprise value of $2.9B, and it appears that the market is placing a <em>zero to negative</em> value on ATI's Flat-Rolled Products business. Now, I never learned about negative business enterprise values in school (or in any subsequent experience), so I believe that Mr. Market is simply mis-pricing ATI at these levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>4) Alcoa just laid out the roadmap for separating out ATI's High Performance business.</strong> In my prior article, I argued that an activist investor might be so inclined as to fight for the spin-off of ATI's High Performance segment. With Alcoa's move today, precedent has been established for ATI to separate into two separate companies. And I believe it would unlock the value of ATI's High Performance segment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>ATI is getting pushed around right now, but the value is there.</strong> Risks certainly remain with Allegheny Technologies Incorporated. I do not trust management with this company, and a change in management has been needed for some time. The company needs to focus on harvesting the CapEx investments it has made over the last several years, and forget about growing the Flat-Rolled business; just harvest what you can from it and move on. It's time to focus on the High Performance segment and unlock the value there. Separating out that business may be just what the doctor ordered for ATI and ATI's long-suffering investors.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Alcoa Just Laid Out The Roadmap For Allegheny Technologies Incorporated; It's Time To Separate Into 2 Companies. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3539756-alcoa-just-laid-out-roadmap-for-allegheny-technologies-incorporated-time-to-separate-2?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "89426", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "162977", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1105", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "2438", "type": "tag"}]}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "518206", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3539756-alcoa-just-laid-out-roadmap-for-allegheny-technologies-incorporated-time-to-separate-2", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3539756-alcoa-just-laid-out-roadmap-for-allegheny-technologies-incorporated-time-to-separate-2", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "89426", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "keuka-capital", "userId": 40423716, "tagId": 518206, "bio": "<p>Keuka Capital, LLC is an unregistered investment advisor that partners with clients to manage their investment account.
