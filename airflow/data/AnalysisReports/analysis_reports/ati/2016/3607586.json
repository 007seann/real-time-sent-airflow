I argued that an abatement of nickel pricing, oil &amp; gas, union labor, and operational execution headwinds could lead the stock higher, with the High Performance segment's aerospace exposure providing ballast in a turbulent steel and specialty metal environment.</p> <p>I followed that article up with a second <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/3539756-alcoa-just-laid-out-roadmap-for-allegheny-technologies-incorporated-time-to-separate-2\">article</a> arguing that ATI should consider splitting into two companies, similar to Alcoa's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AA\" title=\"Alcoa Corporation\">AA</a>) action taken a month ago. I elaborated on my belief that Allegheny Technologies Incorporated's High Performance segment alone could be worth more than the entire company was valued at the time (slightly higher than it is today). I based my EBITDA valuation on ATI's High Performance segment's 1H15 EBITDA annualized, which implied my view that High Performance sales and EBITDA margins were sustainable through the remainder of the year, mostly due to strong aerospace &amp; defense exposure.</p> <p><strong>I was wrong; ATI's 3Q15 report showed that things can, and did, get much worse</strong></p> <p>But I was wrong. ATI's 3Q15 report included sharp declines in High Performance revenues and margins; even aerospace &amp; defense volumes declined qoq. But it was the damning realization that ATI appears to be losing market share in most non-aerospace &amp; defense markets that put the \"nail in the (proverbial) coffin,\" in my view. Asset utilization appears to be declining to a point that ATI can no longer remain profitable, even in its High Performance segment.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Allegheny Technologies' Q3 2015 Earnings: So Poor, I'm Changing My View. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3607586-allegheny-technologies-q3-2015-earnings-poor-changing-view?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isMpwLocked": true, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "89426", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "518206", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3607586-allegheny-technologies-q3-2015-earnings-poor-changing-view", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3607586-allegheny-technologies-q3-2015-earnings-poor-changing-view", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/26/40423716-14458952560979364-Keuka-Capital_origin.jpg", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/10/26/40423716-14458952560979364-Keuka-Capital_origin.jpg"}}}, "included": [{"id": "89426", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "keuka-capital", "userId": 40423716, "tagId": 518206, "bio": "<p>Keuka Capital, LLC is an unregistered investment advisor that partners with clients to manage their investment account.
