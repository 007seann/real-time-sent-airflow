In this article, we'll examine the three reasons why.</p> <p><b>1. Fundamentals</b></p> <p>When it comes to investing, we believe a company's stock price will eventually match its fundamental value. That's why we look for (1) <em>companies that grow shareholder value</em> and that (2) <em>trade at prices with low implied expectations</em>. Similarly, we avoid overpriced companies that fail to build shareholder value.</p> <p>When it comes to the first part of that equation, we fear that ATI has a poor history of growing shareholder value.</p> <p>For one, ATI's growth in COGS is beginning to outstrip its revenue growth.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/23/saupload_4301b186a75f25706cde1674924f0ecd.png\" alt=\"ATI Net Income (&lt;a href=\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p><em>Source: YCharts</em></p> <p>That explains why, despite its high revenue ($4.26B), ATI hasn't been enjoying much earnings growth, with its net income staying flat (around ~$15M). This leads us to worry: if growing revenue won't lead to its increased profits due to the simultaneous increase in COGS, <em>what will</em>? We don't know.</p> <p>At the same time, its ROA (0.23%) and ROE (0.55%) are nearly rounding errors, while its operating margin (3.07%) and profit margin (0.35%) are razor-thin (<em>all TTM, YCharts</em>).</p> <p>We think this combination presents low value for investors. Especially, as we'll see next, when we consider its implied price premium.</p> <p><strong>2. Price And Its Expectations</strong></p> <p>To analyze whether investors are getting a discount - or paying a premium - for a stock, we like to reverse-engineer investors' future performance<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> expectations by examining the assumptions built into its current stock price. That way, we can break down what expectations are implied by its price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a high P/E of 120.26 and a low forward P/E of 10.83, ATI has a <em>one-year implied earnings growth rate</em> of ~1,038%. High, in our opinion, for a company with a checkered past of missing on earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/23/34475985-14430241699324968-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/23/34475985-14430241699324968-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Zacks.com</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So ATI has lackluster fundamentals while trading at a price that implies high growth. That's a bad recipe for investors. And there's more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>3. Dividend Sustainability?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We know lots of investors love dividends; we love them, too. We also know that ATI's high dividend of &gt;4% is tempting. Nevertheless, we advise investors not to fall under the spell of this particularly tempting dividend stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">First, though, we'll reveal one of our biases. Our bias is as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"Depreciation\" <em>isn't just a fiction designed to annoy investors who are obsessed with cash flow as a measure of economic health. It's a charge against assets that wear out.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Depreciation represents cash that will need to be paid out in the future to replace or repair machinery that has worn out. The rate at which we calculate depreciation may be too low or too high, but depreciation matters because physical plant has a useful life and needs to be replaced. With that in mind, we note the following from the company's latest three years of cash flow statements.</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>For the three years ending December 31, 2014, the company has generated ~$852 million from operations. Alarmingly, cash from operations was 87% lower in 2014 than it was in 2012.</li> <li>The company incurred $560 million in depreciation expenses in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014. We assume most of this represents a charge against future earnings, given that physical plant must eventually be replaced.</li> <li>The company paid $230.5 million in dividends to shareholders. In spite of an obvious slowdown in business from 2013 to 2014, the company increased the dividends paid out marginally.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Taking all of the above together, depreciation (non-cash, but somewhat representative of future cash requirements) plus cash dividends were $790.5 million. Cash from operations was $852 million. We consider this to be fairly thin coverage. This is especially thin in light of the negative trends in revenue, earnings and cash from operations. Thus, we believe there's a good chance that in the next three years the company will either need to shave the dividend or take on debt in order to fund it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When it comes to investing, we look for companies that grow shareholder value that come at a cheap price and avoid companies that fail to build shareholder value, especially when those companies are priced at a premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Unfortunately, ATI fits into the latter category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For investors buying it for its dividend, be cautious - that dividend may not be sustainable. If it isn't, and ATI is forced to cut it, you may be in for a painful ride down.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe investors should always be on the lookout for a disconnect between a company's price-implied-expectations and its fundamental value - when it works in investors' favor. Yet for ATI, we find the exact opposite of an \"edge\" for investors: its expectations are too high, while its fundamental value is too low. That, combined with its potentially unsustainable dividend, make ATI a high risk to shareholders. If you own, sell; if you don't own, avoid.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - 3 Problems With Allegheny Technologies. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3529916-3-problems-allegheny-technologies?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "78265", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "477895", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "460745", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3529916-3-problems-allegheny-technologies", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3529916-3-problems-allegheny-technologies", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/23/saupload_4301b186a75f25706cde1674924f0ecd.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/23/saupload_4301b186a75f25706cde1674924f0ecd.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "78265", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "doyle-publishing-ltd", "userId": 34475985, "tagId": 477895, "bio": "We are a team of market professionals with 18 years combined experience as investment advisers and stock analysts.
