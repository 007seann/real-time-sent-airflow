Their most popular products are titanium, nickel-based alloys and flat rolled steel. The company has seen their stock price sink since mid-2014 with the downturn of the energy industry. Now that ATI shares are cheap, is this a buying opportunity for potential investors?</p> <p><a href=\"https://library.morningstar.com/stock/analyst-report?t=ATI&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berkshire Hathaway is notorious</a> for buying up companies that are 1) difficult for competitors to enter their industry sector, 2) have potential for long-term growth, 3) are reasonably priced due to short term obstacles. One of the more recent acquisitions was ATI's competitor, Precision Castparts Corp (NYSE: PCP). Though PCP and others in its industry have been struggling with low oil prices, a purchase from Berkshire Hathaway is a telltale of the industry's long-term value.</p> <p>The short-term obstacle facing these specialized metal companies is the lower demand from oil and gas customers. As the energy producers collect lower earnings, they spend less on new equipment. Allegheny Technologies is a good company that's dealing with the same challenges as PCP. Though oil has taken its toll, Allegheny has another advantage. They are the market leader in production of specialty metals that appeal to aircraft manufactures. They have leveraged this market very well, and changes in the aerospace industry puts ATI in a great position. Here are three reasons ATI is now a buying opportunity:</p> <p>1. Increasing demand from other markets</p> <p>With its precision forgings and titanium investment strategy, ATI has hedged its bets that titanium demand will increase in several areas. Aerospace is now reliant on titanium and uses it in every major airframe. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.aspireaviation.com/2015/08/20/airbus-boeing-defining-moments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sources say</a> that commercial airlines foresee a need for 1,550 new \"very large airplanes\" (<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">VLAs</span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) in the next 20 years, showing a steady growth in air travel. These new aircraft are expected to use considerably higher proportions of titanium. As that aerospace demand grows, another growing customer base is the emerging market of 3D printing. </span><a href=\"https://3dprint.com/82431/3d-printing-titanium-market-gets-boost-from-rti-investment-in-norsk-titanium/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Titanium alloy and nickel alloy are becoming popular</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> materials for the new manufacturing method because of its malleable properties. 3D printing is becoming more prominent for its ability to make intricate parts at low cost and less time. Some uses include aircraft parts and medical devices. </span><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/innovations-in-medical-manufacturing-at-westec-2015-2015-08-17\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Leading medical companies are beginning</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to use titanium 3D printing in the areas of implantable devices, prosthetics, orthopedic implants, dental devices and other biometrics.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Just like Berkshire Hathaway, companies are seeing the rapid growth of titanium demand and are <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2015/04/long-time-aerospace-innovator-bets-on-titanium.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying up producers left and right</a>. One example is Alcoa's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/A\" title=\"Agilent Technologies, Inc.\">A</a>) <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/09/rti-intl-metals-ma-alcoa-idUSL1N0WB0D020150309\" rel=\"nofollow\">move to acquire RTI</a> International Metals Inc. after seeing the future value in titanium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">2. Oil and gas customer demand will return</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With these other markets sustaining them, ATI is operating effectively in the current environment. When oil and gas prices rise, their full earnings potential will be restored. Oil and gas producers are coming up with new ways to extract resources every day. These new methods require strong, specialized equipment that's right up ATI's alley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">3. Morningstar gives ATI an excellent rating</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Morningstar currently has ATI listed as a five-star stock. They have set a fair value estimate of $36, which means the stock is currently trading at nearly a 50% discount. They have a \"Consider Buying\" price of anything under $21.60 (the stock is currently trading around $19) and a \"Consider Sell\" price of $55.80. This sell price represents a gain of nearly triple from current prices. At current prices, ATI is a great value buy for long-term growth. With the oil and gas industry suppressing metal producers' stock prices, now is an excellent time to buy ATI.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - 3 Reasons To Buy Allegheny Technologies. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3456376-3-reasons-to-buy-allegheny-technologies?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "65663", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": [{"id": "161025", "type": "sentiment"}]}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "153843", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "460745", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3456376-3-reasons-to-buy-allegheny-technologies", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3456376-3-reasons-to-buy-allegheny-technologies", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "65663", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "samuel-riehn", "userId": 21022491, "tagId": 153843, "bio": "Long/Short Equity, Contrarian, Deep Value, Special Situations", "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/021/022/491/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/021/022/491/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/021/022/491/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/021/022/491/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "Samuel Riehn", "deactivated": null, "memberSince": 2014, "isRss": false, "contributorSince": 2014, "followersCount": 994}, "relationships": {"user": {"data": {"id": "21022491", "type": "user"}}, "userBioTags": {"data": [{"id": "230653", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "230663", "type": "userBioTag"}, {"id": "230673", "type": "userBioTag"}]}, "authorResearch": {"data": null}}, "links": {"self": "/author/samuel-riehn", "profileUrl": "/author/samuel-riehn", "site": null, "linkedinUrl": null, "twitterUrl": null}}, {"id": "2607", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "ati", "name": "ATI", "company": "ATI Inc.", "tagKind": "Tags::Ticker", "equityType": "stocks", "exchange": "NYSE", "fundTypeId": 0, "isDefunct": false, "currency": "USD", "isBdc": false, "isReit": false, "isEtf": false}, "relationships": {"sector": {"data": {"id": "15", "type": "sector"}}}, "links": {"self": "/symbol/ATI"}}, {"id": "153843", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "samuel-riehn", "name": "Samuel Riehn", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::AuthorTag"}, "links": {"self": "/author/samuel-riehn"}}, {"id": "1936", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "long-ideas", "name": "Long Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Theme"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=long-ideas"}}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "industrial-goods", "name": "Industrial Goods", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/industrial-goods"}}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "sa-exclusive", "name": "SA Exclusive", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/sa-exclusive"}}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "premium-base-payment", "name": "", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/premium-base-payment"}}, {"id": "460745", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "early-look", "name": "Early Look", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/early-look"}}, {"id": "10727", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "investing-ideas", "name": "Investing Ideas", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Dashboard"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/investing-ideas"}}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "us", "name": "United States", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tags::Country"}, "links": {"self": "/articles?filters=us"}}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag", "attributes": {"slug": "metal-fabrication", "name": "Metal Fabrication", "company": null, "tagKind": "Tag"}, "links": {"self": "/tag/metal-fabrication"}}, {"id": "161025", "type": "sentiment", "attributes": {"articleId": 3456376, "type": "bullish", "createdAt": "2015-08-21T17:33:49.000-04:00", "typeId": 1}, "relationships": {"article": {"data": {"id": "3456376", "type": "article"}}, "tag": {"data": {"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}}}}]}
