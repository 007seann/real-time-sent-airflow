In addition to this, the company is dealing with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2729286-allegheny-technologies-issues-lockout-notice\">lockout of more than 2,000 employees</a> that dates back to August. Since being at $37 per share in the spring, the company's stock has dropped more than two-thirds, creating growth in the dividend yield to nearly 6%.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_0.png\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p> <p>When examining the company's dividend sustainability statistics, I noted quite a bit of volatility. ATI has had quarters of negative earnings, which causes the quarterly metrics to jump. In this case, reviewing the numbers on a trailing 12-month basis is ideal. ATI has paid out 72 cents per share in dividends over the past four quarters, compared to 12 cents per share in earnings. With a payout ratio of 600%, the company clearly fails the payout ratio threshold.</p> <p>In terms of free cash flow, ATI pays out an estimated $78 million in dividends every 12 months. In the previous three years, ATI has had adequate free cash flow to pay out dividends twice. Despite the combination of inadequate dividend coverage and two years of negative free cash flow, a silver lining exists. In Q3 2015, ATI's free cash flow turned positive on a trailing 12-month basis. If this type of performance continues, it may have adequate free cash flow coverage of the dividend by 2016.</p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_1.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p>One advantage that ATI has is that it is trading at a discounted price-to-book ratio (under 0.6). This allows a company with a higher yield to pay out a smaller percentage of funds in relation to equity, thus making the dividend payment easier to attain. To determine the sustainability on these grounds, we look at the price-to-book value multiplied by the dividend yield. This gives us a required return on equity of about 3%. Due to<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> earnings weakness, ATI is slightly above zero on ROE, but not enough to sustain the dividend.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_2.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After seeing these statistics, I became curious about how ATI was funding its dividend over the past two years. The easiest way to do this is to review the cash flow statement in the company's 10-Q or 10-K filings. In ATI's case, it has been funding its operational shortfalls through depleting cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From the FY2014 10-K filing:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_3.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From the Q3 2015 10-Q filing:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_4.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The improvement in free cash flow could not come at a better time for ATI. The company can use cash to pay out the next couple of quarters of dividends, provided operational performance does not deteriorate. After that, it may be more prudent to cut the dividend than to finance through debt issuance (assets in this industry are not the most attractive collateral). Overall, this makes ATI's Q4 2015 earnings report crucial in respect to whether or not the operation will be able to sustain the dividend via free cash flow.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">All charts were generated via an internally managed spreadsheet and the dashboard is viewable at <a href=\"https://www.stockarray.com/p/allegheny-technologies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Allegheny Technologies' dashboard</a> on the Stock Array website.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Allegheny Technologies' 6% Yield: Is It Sustainable?. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3710806-allegheny-technologies-6-percent-yield-is-sustainable?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "62623", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "145553", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "156", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "16549", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3710806-allegheny-technologies-6-percent-yield-is-sustainable", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3710806-allegheny-technologies-6-percent-yield-is-sustainable", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_0.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/20858741_14482917825705_0.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "62623", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "jeremy-lakosh", "userId": 20858741, "tagId": 145553, "bio": "<p>About My Writing: I am currently focused on income investing through either common shares, preferred shares, or bonds.\u00a0 I will occasionally break away and write about the economy at large or a special situation involving a company I've been researching in.\u00a0</p><p>I target two articles per week for publication on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>About My Background: Bachelors in history/political science, Masters in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance and Economics.
