Our view is that this is another company that is singing the siren song of eventual aerospace profits, and that it would be better for investors to seek returns elsewhere. We believe there are problems with both the financials of the underlying business, as well as the forecasts embedded in the current price. In the following analysis, we'll review the net operating profit as a function of the capital employed to make that profit. We'll also look at the level of optimism embedded in the current share price and we'll conclude with a comparison between Allegheny and one of its peers. If you were considering buying this company, don't. If you own it, take your lumps and seek positive returns elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Poor Operating Yield</strong></p> <p>Before getting into the analysis, we should say that it's strange to us that the depreciation expense doesn't show up on the income statement. It <em>does</em> appear on the statement of cash flows, though, as a huge add back to net income. Also, depreciation is obviously going on here, because ~$1.8 billion of accumulated depreciation appears recorded against property plant and equipment. There's no sign that the depreciation expense is embedded in the cost of goods sold (it would be very eccentric to lump them together). We'll note the absence of depreciation on the income statement and move on. Even without accounting for depreciation, returns look weak here.</p> <p>When we compare the net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) to the amount of capital provided by owners and creditors in order to generate that return, we see results that are<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> barely greater than the risk free rate. Specifically, the company has generated a yield of about 3.25%, as compared to the current risk free rate yield of ~2.2%. The company earned this meager return in spite of the fact that there was a net tax benefit for 2014, which may not be repeated. Thus, our results may make returns look too good. Also, we should note that in 2014, the net operating profit after tax did not cover the net interest expense. This is worrying because debt has ballooned over the past six years at a CAGR of ~20% and shows no signs of coming down (specifically, debt's moved from $494 million in late 2008 to $1.509 billion now). For all of these reasons, we consider the yield to be inadequate compensation for the risks present here.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368206701216228-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368206701216228-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Company filings</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Optimistically Priced Shares</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We focus a great deal on the level of optimism present in a name because too much optimism is quite dangerous to investors. If a company does the near impossible and achieves the optimistic goals the market has set for it, shares likely won't do much as optimism is already \"baked in.\" If optimistic forecasts are not met, as is usually the case, shares react violently and suddenly as formerly optimistic investors switch polarity and drive prices down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At the moment, the PE for the company is ~115.7 and the forward PE for the firm is <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/XNYS/ATI/quote.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">14.1</a>. Holding all else constant, in order for this very optimistic forecast to be realised, earnings would need to jump at a CAGR of ~720%. We consider this to be way too hopeful given the company's earnings history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368207996150708-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Gurufocus</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Peer Comparison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When we compare Allegheny to one of its peers (Mueller Industries), we see that Allegheny is a more expensive stock and a worse performing company than its peer. This is not to say that we like Mueller Industries and it's certainly not to say that Mueller isn't cheaper for reasons specific to it. But since investing is at heart a relativistic process, it makes sense for investors to understand some of the alternatives available to them. In our view, it would be wise to expand beyond the metal fabrication space, but if one <em>must</em> buy there, Mueller may represent the better combination of risk and reward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368209379100919-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-.png\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" loading=\"lazy\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>Source: Gurufocus</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We believe that investors would be wise to take their lumps with Allegheny, as there seems to be no significant catalyst on the horizon that will improve operating earnings and drive debt down. Further, the market has forecast a very significant growth rate in earnings, though the company has had no history of such massive earnings gains. In the final analysis, investing is about finding that adequate combination of high return and low price and this company has neither.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - What To Do With Allegheny Technologies. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3322495-what-to-do-with-allegheny-technologies?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null, "audioDuration": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "78265", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2607", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "477895", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17913", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17335", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "162415", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "460745", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17927", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/3322495-what-to-do-with-allegheny-technologies", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/3322495-what-to-do-with-allegheny-technologies", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368206701216228-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-_origin.png", "schemaImage": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/13/34475985-14368206701216228-Doyle-Publishing-Ltd-_origin.png"}}}, "included": [{"id": "78265", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "doyle-publishing-ltd", "userId": 34475985, "tagId": 477895, "bio": "We are a team of market professionals with 18 years combined experience as investment advisers and stock analysts.
