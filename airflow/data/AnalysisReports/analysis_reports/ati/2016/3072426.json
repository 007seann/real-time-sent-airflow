The company's shares are trading 70% lower than their 2007 peak and are even substantially lower than their 52 week high. The value seekers are certainly swarming around ATI but there is another piece to this story. ATI aggressively raised its dividend in the years leading up to the crisis such that it has a very nice payout per share that is a relic from the commodity boom of 2007. But, importantly, the company did not cut its dividend as so many other materials companies did so in this article, I'll take a look at ATI's financials to see how likely it is that the company can actually begin raising its dividend again.</p> <p>To do this I'll be using data I've gathered from <a href=\"https://quotes.morningstar.com/stock/s?t=ATI&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morningstar</a>.</p> <p>We'll begin with a quick look at the company's per share payout for the last decade.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId5.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId5_thumb.jpg\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></a></span></p> <p>We can see the company was in the midst of ramping its dividend higher when the commodity bubble burst and since that time, the 72 cent annual dividend has remained stagnant. The good news is, however, that ATI has resisted the urge to cut the dividend. There are so many materials companies that had the same situation as ATI when the recession hit that took the easy road and just slashed their dividend but ATI hasn't done so. This speaks volumes to management's commitment to shareholders returns because as we'll see, I don't think ATI can really afford its current dividend.</p> <p>This data will show us the company's profits against the cost of its dividend for the past ten years.</p> <p><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId6.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId6_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p>This chart really shows the boom/bust cycle in commodities that we<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> saw leading up to and following the financial crisis. ATI was in full swing and making lots of money prior to the recession but we can see profits all but disappeared as the bubble burst. A company that once made $750 million in one year has been relegated to $200 million or less since the recession including a small loss in 2014.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We can also see that the cost of the dividend has remained fairly steady, a condition you'd expect knowing that the per share payout hasn't moved for several years. But we can also see that there are years where the company's earnings don't cover its dividend. So does this mean the dividend is in trouble? Not necessarily, and the reason is because we're looking at the wrong data to make that determination.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The payout ratio -- the components of which we just looked at -- is a meaningless metric that is supposed to assess the quality of a dividend. Unfortunately, it has a serious fundamental flaw; the metric is based upon comparing two numbers that should not be compared. Net income is nothing more than an accounting metric; it's useful for assessing profitability but that's about it. It is not cash and does not represent money that can be used to pay anything, including the dividend. On the other hand, the dividend payment does represent real cash that is flowing out of the business so it must be supported by cash coming into the business. Since net income does not represent cash, it makes no sense to compare them. The good news is that all we need to do is switch out net income for free cash flow, as I've done below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId7.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId7_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This is a very interesting chart in light of the profit numbers we just saw. First, FCF is even more erratic than net income. The numbers bounce around more including going solidly negative in several of the years in our dataset. In addition, for the years that are positive, the company's net income is well in excess of its FCF. That's not a desirable condition because it means ATI is earning paper profits that aren't the result of cash being generated by the business. So what's happening to all of that cash?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em></em><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId8.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/5847171_14290592427855_rId8_thumb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A lot of it is being used by capex as ATI is certainly in a capex-heavy business. In other words, even when ATI manages to produce cash from operations, a substantial amount of that cash is used up in investments in the business. That can make it tricky to be able to afford capital returns because as we saw earlier, when capex is high, FCF has a tendency to dip below zero and that's not good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So what does all of this mean? For me, it means ATI can't actually afford its dividend. I know it has been paying the dividend and by all indications will continue to do so, but the fact remains that its FCF simply isn't high enough to support the dividend. However, this does not mean a cut is coming. I mentioned management's steadfast defense of the dividend before and even <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/2834666-allegheny-s-ati-ceo-rich-harshman-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\">recent commentary</a> from management suggests that the company will continue to pay it. This is a big reason -- in my view -- why the company has been a net borrower in recent years. It cannot produce enough cash to build out its business and make acquisitions in addition to its dividend. Thus, it borrows. There's nothing inherently wrong with this practice as long as the debt load is sustainable and the dividend isn't too burdensome. I think both of those conditions exist right now for ATI so I don't think there's really any plausible scenario where the dividend gets cut.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The question of raises is more challenging because as I mentioned, ATI can't really afford its current dividend, let alone a higher one. Management seems to think the FCF situation is improving this year with less capex so that should help but ATI has a long way to go before it can sustain its dividend via FCF. In addition to that, management has expressed interest in returning cash via share repurchases, another form of capital returns it can't afford right now. Therefore, if FCF does move much higher I think instead of a higher dividend, we'll see buybacks first. So while raises may be years down the road, I don't think the current dividend is going anywhere. And if you like the ATI fundamental story at $30, a 2.4% yield isn't a bad consolation prize to wait.</p>", "twitContent": "$ATI - Can Allegheny Tech Finally Raise Its Dividend Again?. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3072426-can-allegheny-tech-finally-raise-its-dividend-again?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": null, "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": "I am Josh Arnold, a technician with a decade of experience following price action and money flows.
